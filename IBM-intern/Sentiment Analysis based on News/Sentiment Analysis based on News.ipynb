       "    'title': \"France's Competition Regulator Details in Great Depth the reasoning for their Record US$1.2 Billion Fine against Apple \",\n",
       "    'body': 'Last Thursday Patently Apple posted a report titled \"France\\'s Competition Regulator is set to Fine Apple heavily on Monday for its anticompetitive behavior.\" On cue, Apple was hit with a hefty €1.1 billion or US$1.2 billion fine by France\\'s Competition Regulator known as Autorité de la Concurrence. Our report covers the in-depth detail behind their reasoning for fining Apple.\\n\\nFrance\\'s Competition Regulator published a press release that reads as follows (translated from French):\\n\\n\"Seized in 2012 by eBizcuss, distributor of high-end specialty Apple products (known as APR for Apple Premium Reseller), the Competition Authority sanctioned Apple to the tune of 1.1 billion euros, as well as wholesalers Tech Data and Ingram Micro to the tune 62.9 million and 76.1 million euros respectively. The sanction decision follows visitation and seizure operations at the headquarters of Apple and its wholesalers, whose litigation ended in December 2017.\\n\\nIn total, the penalties amount to 1.24 billion euros and are broken down as follows:\\n\\nIsabelle de Silva, President of the Competition Authority said: \"The Authority has deciphered, on the occasion of this case, the very specific practices that had been implemented by Apple for the distribution of its products in France (excluding iPhones), such as the iPad.\\n\\nFirst, Apple and its two wholesalers agreed not to compete and prevent distributors from competing with each other, sterilizing the wholesale market for Apple products.\\n\\nSecond, so-called Premium distributors could not safely promote or lower prices, which led to an alignment of retail prices between Apple\\'s integrated distributors and independent Premium distributors.\\n\\nFinally, Apple has misused the economic dependence of these Premium distributors on them, subjecting them to unfair and unfavorable commercial conditions in relation to its network of integrated distributors. In view of the strong impact of these practices on competition in the distribution of Apple products via Apple premium resellers, the Authority imposes the highest penalty ever imposed in a case (1.24 billion euros).\\n\\nIt is also the heaviest sanction imposed on an economic player, in this case Apple (1.1 billion euros), whose extraordinary dimension has been duly taken into account.\\n\\nFinally, the Authority found that, in this case, Apple had committed an abuse of economic dependence on its premium retailers, a practice which the Authority considers to be particularly serious.\"\\n\\nApple is accused of having implemented three anti-competitive practices in France within its electronics distribution network (excluding iPhone):\\n\\nA distribution of products and customers between its two wholesalers Tech Data and Ingram Micro. The two wholesalers involved were also sanctioned to the tune of 139 million euros for accepting and implementing the product and customer allocation mechanisms developed and managed by Apple, instead of freely determining their policy (see details of sanctions in the summary table below).\\n\\nThese practices have somehow \"sterilized\" the wholesale market for Apple products, freezing market share and preventing competition between the various distribution channels of the Apple brand.\\n\\nSelling prices imposed on Premium Retailers (RPOs) to apply the same prices as Apple itself, in Apple Stores and on its website.\\n\\nThis practice has resulted in end-users aligning the selling prices of Apple products with nearly half of the Apple retail market.\\n\\nAn abuse of economic dependence on premium resellers (mostly SMEs), which has manifested itself in particular by supply difficulties, discriminatory treatment, and instability of the remuneration conditions of their business (discounts and outstandings).\\n\\nThese practices consisted, in a context where distributor margins were extremely low, to keep distributors in extreme dependence on the reception of products, especially the most in-demand (new products).\\n\\nThe Authority found that, when new products were launched, RPOs were deprived of inventory so that they could not respond to orders made to them, while the network of Apple Stores and retailers was regularly supplied. This resulted in them losing customers, including regular customers. They have even sometimes been forced, in response to an order, to source themselves from other distribution channels, for example by ordering themselves directly from an Apple Store as a final customer would have done in order to supply their customers.\\n\\nThese practices have resulted in the weakening, and in some cases, the ouster of some of them, such as eBizcuss.\\n\\nIf a manufacturer is free to organize its distribution system as it sees fit, to delineate different sales channels, to choose wholesalers to supply certain retailers and to reserve the direct supply of other retailers, it must respect competition law, as long as the players in the distribution network are independent and are not part of the group.\\n\\nIn particular, it is prohibited for a network-head manufacturer to interfere with the competition that its wholesalers must engage in by pre-assigning customers, to agree with its distributors on retail prices for end-users, or to abuse the economic dependency situation in which its trading partners find themselves, in particular by putting them at a disadvantage compared to its own internal distribution network.\\n\\nThe Authority found that, from 2005 to March 2013, Apple had distributed products and customers between its two wholesalers, Tech Data and Ingram Micro. While these two wholesalers were independent companies.\\n\\nApple made a fine allocation of the distribution of its products, specifying to the two wholesalers the exact quantities of the different products to be delivered to each reseller. APR resellers were thus able to be held back in their commercial activity, being totally dependent on the stocks decided by Apple, both at the wholesale level and at their level.\\n\\nIf a supplier is free to organize its distribution network by distinguishing several channels and using wholesalers to approach certain retailers, while ensuring the direct supply of other retailers, it is provided that this division of tasks does not result in anti-competitive practice. As stand-alone economic operators in the market, wholesalers should have had the opportunity to freely determine their trade policy, including freely determining the products they wanted to distribute, and then how they would deliver their retail customers, without Apple\\'s interference.\\n\\nIn this case, Apple has restricted the commercial freedom of its wholesalers, restricting them to the performance of the product allocations decided by Apple. They agreed to this policy by implementing the allocations decided by Apple. The resulting restriction of competition is all the more problematic since they happen to be in direct competition with Apple itself for the supply of a number of premium resellers, known as \"direct\" APR (resellers with a high turnover in Apple products and therefore chosen to purchase directly from Apple or from wholesalers).\\n\\nThis device has therefore resulted in distorting competition in the wholesale market by fully controlling sales made by wholesalers and allowing Apple to advantage its own distribution channel, controlling the way products are supplied on the one hand, direct resellers and, on the other hand, so-called \"indirect\" resellers (i.e. those who feed exclusively from wholesalers).\\n\\nThus, the competition that should in principle have existed in France for the sale of Apple-branded products between the various distribution channels - so-called \"intra-brand\" competition - has not been fully exercised in the wholesale market. The practice of cartels has also led to annihilation of competition between the two wholesalers themselves, as well as between wholesalers and Apple. It also limited competition between end-retailers by preventing them from competing with wholesalers upstream.\\n\\nThe Authority also sanctioned Apple for strongly inciting APR resellers to charge the same prices as those charged in Apple Stores. In addition to communicating Prices, promotion control and price monitoring, the evidence on the record shows that Apple has developed a web of contractual clauses and implemented a set of behaviours that have left no room for manoeuvre for RPOs.\\n\\nFirst, Apple distributed the prices of its Apple Retail Stores (presented as \"advised\" prices), on many media, including, on its website, accessible to end consumers.\\n\\nSecondly, several very restrictive contractual clauses relating to the use of the brand in communication and marketing media strictly framed the conditions under which the RPOs could organise a promotional operation. These stipulations, which in particular required RPOs to use Apple-imposed media and equipment when implementing promotions, were likely to netract any initiative in this area, especially since their non-compliance was grounds for immediate and unanerate breach of APR\\'s contract. In practice, RPOs did not offer many promotions, and were still under Apple\\'s control.\\n\\nThird, a price monitoring system also posed a risk of retaliation - in the form of a failure to deliver - in the event of promotions not authorized by Apple.\\n\\nFor example, RPA Youcast stated, \"If we applied too systematic discounts and the salesperson in our sector knew, our competitors could be privileged in their deliveries.\"\\n\\nOr, eBizcuss: \"We see that Apple is doing a price policy to the consumer. If prices are lower than Apple\\'s public prices, we are contacted by the Apple Sales Local Representatives to ask us to raise prices.\"\\n\\nFinally, the investigation revealed that Apple - which had in-depth knowledge of the situation of RPOs and controlled their supply and the granting of the rebates to which they were entitled - was able to control their profitability. This lack of economic space and uncertainty have also played a major role in deterring RPOs from deviating from Apple\\'s \"advised\" prices.\\n\\nCorsidev\\'s testimony in this regard states: \"No room for manoeuvre is really possible. They wouldn\\'t stop us from lowering prices but the margins are so low that it would be suicidal to do so.\"\\n\\nOr that of Computer Science and Prevention, which stated: \"For Apple products, our price repository is the matrix of Apple products with the associated price list: free for us to apply a discount depending on the competitive context, it is still complicated and dangerous to discount our sales given the weakness of our margin.\"\\n\\nThe retail distribution of Apple products in France now uses two separate channels: on the one hand, the \"integrated\" stores owned by Apple (Apple Store and the Internet) and on the other hand, some 2000 independent resellers (which are sourced through wholesalers or directly from Apple). These resellers are autonomous economic players and must therefore be able to freely determine their trade policy (choice of products and quantities ordered, choice of supplier, prices charged, promotions, etc.).\\n\\nHeavily constrained, the RPOs admitted to practising the prices \"advised\" by Apple, which is further corroborated by the price statements on file. As a result, this practice has resulted in a perfect alignment of sales prices to end-users, for almost half of the retail market for Apple products (excluding iPhone).\\n\\nBy restricting the pricing freedom of RPOs, Apple has been able to limit not only the competition that can be exerted between the RPOs themselves but also the competition between them and its own (physical) distribution channels, when they were present in the same geographic area, or online (Apple Online Store). This practice has finally harmed consumers who have been deprived of real price competition across Apple product distribution channels.\\n\\nThe evidence on the record highlights the fact that the RPOs were in a position of economic dependence on Apple and that Apple abused it. This situation, rarely observed in the decision-making practice of the Council and then of the Competition Authority3, the result of a complex tangle of multiple contractual clauses and practices.\\n\\nThe Authority noted that the APR contracts required them to sell Apple products almost exclusively and prohibited them, for their duration, and up to six months after their term, from opening any store specializing in the exclusive sale of a brand competing across Europe. Moreover, the lack of an alternative to the distribution of Apple products was highlighted by the statements of the RPD: all stressed that their customers were strongly attached to the Apple brand and that the release of the Apple universe would result, for them, by the total loss of value of their trade funds, by unrecoverable investments, as well as by significant store redevelopment and staff training costs, which are impossible to achieve in the short term for operators in the already fragile situations.\\n\\nArticle L. 420 2, paragraph 2 of the Code of Commerce, prohibits, as long as it is likely to affect the operation or structure of competition, the abusive exploitation by a company or group of enterprises of the state of economic dependence in which is a client or supplier company.\\n\\nIn this case, the Authority identified a set of rules and behaviors implemented by Apple that, taken together, constitute an abuse by abnormally and excessively restricting the commercial freedom of RPOs. These various factors have directly impacted the activity of RPOs beyond what an economic player can reasonably expect from a trading partner and have created an imbalance in their relationship with Apple.\\n\\nBehaviors included supply difficulties, discriminatory treatment, unstable pay conditions for the APR business (remissions and outstandings), and discretionary implementation of certain rules.\\n\\nDelays or lack of supply,resulting from Apple\\'s allocation system and the disadvantage suffered by RPOs compared to Apple Stores and Apple\\'s online sales site,which are still powered, on time, by Apple products.\\n\\nMost APR resellers reported regular delivery problems, particularly when launching new products or at the end of the year. They faced supply restrictions as a result of Apple\\'s customer allocation policy, either directly or through its wholesalers. Some references were found to be totally unavailable to RPOs.\\n\\nIn addition, when new products were launched, RPOs were often deprived of inventory so that they could not respond to orders made to them, while the Apple Stores network and Retailers were regularly Supplied.\\n\\nThe Authority has demonstrated that these delays or refusals of supply were not the result of stock outages, as they were available in Apple Stores, Apple Online Stores and Retailers.\\n\\nThis discriminatory treatment of RPOs was all the more serious given their particular situation with respect to the manufacturer. APR, on the one hand, is commercially independent, unlike Apple Stores, and must purchase the merchandise in order to carry out their distribution activity. On the other hand, they are forced to source Apple products (which must account for 70% of their sales in order to retain the status of APR reseller) and are placed under its economic dependence, unlike the \"Retailers\", who exercise general distribution activity and are not in a position of dependence on Apple.\\n\\nUncertainty over business conditions, given Apple\\'s policy of rebates and outstandings Maintained in uncertainty about the volume of their supply, the RPOs were also concerned about the conditions of Apple\\'s rebates. The system of remittances to RPOs was discretionary, so there was uncertainty about the amount of rebates paid to RPOs, which were compounded by uncertainty about their deliveries. Given the significant and growing weight of rebates in the profitability of RPOs and in their ability to achieve a positive margin, the unpredictability of the rebate system, arising from contractual clauses and their terms of implementation, is an abuse of economic dependence.\\n\\nAs an illustration, among the many testimonials of the RPOs, we can mention that of Acti Mac who stated: \"Being regularly fed in a minimalist way, we cannot commit to deliver our customers who, weary of war, end up not even asking us by ordering us either on the Store or by going to the nearest ARS [Apple Store].\"\\n\\nAn RPO also noted: \"We never know when a new product is going to be launched, usually there are rumors (...). Apart from iPads and iPhones, product launches are not advertised. For other products there is no announcement, we are usually informed by the press, or we can deduce that there will be a product announcement when some APPLE STORE will announce a new product launch (...). For iPads we are not allowed to communicate around the launch.\"\\n\\nThe particular situation of the company eBizcuss demonstrates the concrete and effective impact of the abuse of dependence of the company Apple. Unable to receive the Apple products needed to satisfy the demand of its own customers or to be able to compete with Apple Stores by price or level of service, eBizcuss stores located in Paris or Lyon have been placed in a disadvantageous position compared to Apple Stores, which resulted in a 15% decrease in sales of these stores.\\n\\nThe president of the APR association also complained of a real \"predatory strategy on the part of Apple\" against the RPOs, as well as the company Alis Informatics which evokes a \"chronicle of a planned death\". You Cast blames its financial difficulties and liquidation procedure, in particular on its \"cash lag concerns related to Apple product delivery problems.\"\\n\\nWhen a manufacturer maintains its distributors in a position of dependence on them, it must be careful not to abuse them, i.e. not to limit their commercial freedom beyond tolerable limits and not to disadvantage them in relation to its internal distribution network.\\n\\nApple, along with the RPOs, benefited from a network whose obligations to the distributors were similar to those of franchisees, without being itself subject to the obligations of a franchisor, thus depriving them of the counterparties attached to this form of distribution. The establishment of this network exempted it from developing its own stores throughout France, which allowed it to concentrate the implementation of Apple Stores in the most profitable areas. With conditions comparable to that of an integrated operator, while having to assume the commercial and financial risks of an independent company, the RPOs allowed Apple to distribute its products throughout the country, without having to invest in its own stores and without the competition of its direct sales (online and in-store).\\n\\nThese practices have resulted in the weakening and, in a number of cases, the ouster of some RPOs, such as eBizcuss.\"',\n",

       "    'title': \"Partners: Ingram Micro, Tech Data Are 'Pawns' In Apple Price-Fixing Practices\",\n",
       "    'body': '\"Ingram and Tech Data are pawns in this. I\\'m sure Ingram and Tech Data had to follow these rules to continue selling Apple. I guarantee Apple said \\'This is what you are going to do or you\\'re not going to have the product.\\'\\n\\nA French antitrust authority\\'s $1.38 billion in fines for price fixing by Apple and its distribution partners Ingram Micro and Tech Data are not surprising given Apple\\'s \"stringent\" channel pricing requirements, said solution providers.\\n\\nOne CEO for a longtime Apple reseller, who did not want to be identified for fear of jeopardizing his Apple reseller contract, said he sees Ingram Micro and Tech as \"pawns\" in Apple\\'s strict pricing actions and channel policies that ultimately end up hurting Apple resellers.\\n\\n\"I am not surprised by this,\" said the CEO. \"Ingram and Tech Data are pawns in this. I\\'m sure Ingram and Tech Data had to follow these rules to continue selling Apple,\" he said. \"I guarantee Apple said \\'This is what you are going to do or you\\'re not going to have the product.\\' I\\'m not saying it is right or wrong. If the distributors don\\'t play by the rules that Apple lays down, they are out - just like us. There are no special prices on Apple when you are buying from distribution. They are similar. You pay the price. We never worry about it too much because we only make five, six or seven percent at most on Apple products. Apple looks at the channel as a second-class citizen.\"\\n\\n[Related: Bad Apple: An Inside look At The Rotting Relationship Between Apple And Its Partners]\\n\\nThe French Competition Authority Monday said Apple was guilty of anti-competitive practices, including creating cartels within its distribution network and abusing the economic dependence of its outside resellers. As a result, the authority fined Apple $1.23 billion; Tech Data $84.8 million and Ingram Micro $70.2 million. The French Competion Authority said the combined $1.38 billion charge was its highest ever for a case.\\n\\nApple did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Ingram Micro in a news release responding to the French agency\\'s decision said it plans to \"vigorously contest\" the decision. Tech Data in a statement provided to CRN said it was still determining how to respond to the sanctions, which cover the distribution of Apple products from 2005 to 2013.\\n\\nSpecifically the French Competition Authority accused Apple, Ingram and Tech Data of agreeing to stick to the same pricing for Apple products other than the iPhone between 2005 and 2013. That caused prices for many Apple products to be the same whether sold by a reseller or Apple itself.\\n\\n\"Apple and its two wholesalers agreed not to compete and prevent distributors from competing with each other, thereby sterilizing the wholesale market for Apple products,\" said the French Competition Authority, according to a translated version of the finding.\\n\\nThe French Competition Authority, in fact, charged the two distributors with implementing \"product and customer allocation mechanisms developed and piloted by Apple instead of freely determining their commercial policy.\"\\n\\nUltimately, the actions of Apple, Tech Data and Ingram Micro \"sterilized\" the wholesale market for Apple products, \"freezing market share and preventing competition between the various distribution channels of the Apple brand,\" said the French Competition Authority.\\n\\nThe Authority also sanctioned Apple for strongly encouraging Apple Premium Resellers (APRs) to charge the same prices as those charged in Apple Stores, according to the French Competition Authority.\\n\\n\"In addition to the communication of prices, the control of promotions and the monitoring of prices, the elements on the record show that Apple has drawn up a web of contractual clauses and implemented a set of behaviors that have left no room for maneuver,\" said the French Competition Authority.\\n\\nIn addition, Apple implemented a \"price monitoring system\" that posed a \"risk of retaliation\" for promotions not authorized by Apple, said the French Competition Authority.\\n\\nThe Apple reseller CEO - who did not want to be identified - said the channel has historically had a pricing disadvantage versus the Apple stores and website, particularly in the education market.\\n\\n\"You absolutely get better pricing from Apple than resellers,\" said the CEO. \"We always get customers walking out the door disappointed and angry thinking we are trying to price gouge them and rip them off because we can\\'t participate in the deals that Apple offers. I would like to see Apple put the resellers on a level playing field. We are a step-child that is treated differently than their own child. That\\'s not fair. Either you are in the family or not. Apple doesn\\'t accept resellers as being part of the Apple family. They treat us as unwanted step-children.\"\\n\\nThe CEO said he has been a frustrated Apple reseller for years, but maintains his status because his customers love Apple and its products.\\n\\n\"At the end of the day, Apple has a fabulous product and customers love them\" he said. \"The problem is they don\\'t have any competition so they can do whatever they want. They have more money in the bank than most countries. They treat the channel like second-class citizens, and yet we are the ones representing them in the field, especially in areas of white space where they have no coverage. It reminds me of being in a relationship that you have to stay in it but you hate going home every night. It\\'s just not a working partnership.\"\\n\\nBob Venero, CEO of Holbrook, N.Y.-based solution provider Future Tech, No. 101 on the CRN 2019 SP500, said Apple has much more \"stringent pricing\" policies than other OEMs.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t have a problem with that because it keeps the fire sales from happening that are just margin erosion for everybody,\" he said. \"There is a reason Apple has so much profitability as a company: because they don\\'t always race to the bottom. There is nothing wrong with that.\"\\'\\n\\nVenero said there will likely be \"more scrutiny\" on Apple from U.S. regulators in the in the wake of the French Competition Authority decision.\\n\\nVenero, as an Apple reseller that relies on distribution, said he sees Apple as an outstanding ethical provider of products. \"We\\'ve never had a problem with Apple,\" he said. \"From our experience, Apple has always acted in an ethical manner. There is always a lot of hate for Apple because they make a lot of money. I defend them. They make a great product and a great operating system. They have created an amazing culture around their product.\"\\n\\nAs for the sanctions against Tech Data and Ingram Micro, Venero said he is not familiar with the exact claims from the French antitrust authority, but that it is up to every business to maintain business integrity and ethics. \"If Ingram Micro and Tech Data believed their business ethics were in question based on the acts of one of their suppliers, it is their responsibility to step up and do the right thing - not to kowtow to a supplier,\" he said.\\n\\nMichael Oh, founder and president of TSP LLC, a Cambridge, Mass.-based managed service provider focused on Apple-PC integration services, audio-visual conference rooms and smart homes, said he got out of the Apple retail business eight years ago because it was simply unprofitable.\\n\\n\"We are still big Apple fans, but we moved away from the Apple ecosystem in terms of reselling and repair,\" he said. \"We are an MSP now with IT services. We were an Apple value-added reseller for 20 years starting in 1993. Apple\\'s early success was built on the independent resellers. Then they made what was a brilliant move to start the Apple store, owning that channel. It is hard to qualify what is anti-competitive or not. What is very clear to me looking back 10 years is that it was a big mistake to think as an independent retailer that you could compete with Apple.\"\\n\\nOh said he wished he never got into the Apple retail business with the Tech Superpowers store at Patriot Place at Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Mass., which closed in 2012. \"We gave it a shot for several years, but we never made a dent,\" he said. \"The margins were never there as an Apple reseller. It is clear that Apple as the manufacturer of the product had extremely deep margins compared to an independent reseller getting the products from Tech Data and Ingram. There is just no way to compete when you are making five times less profit on a product because you are not the manufacturer. I never really thought it was Apple that killed our retail business. I always thought that was just a bad decision. We are still here fighting a different fight and one that we enjoy and doesn\\'t have anything to do with selling Macs. We are now providing services around Apple, cross-platform, and how to manage Mac systems at scale.\"\\n\\nTSP LLC is now doing work for high profile, blue chip clients like the Boston Celtics and renowned Boston venture capitalist Accel, which funded Facebook, Slack and a number of other notable technology companies.\\n\\nThe MSP focus is paying off in big growth for TSP, with the MSP business slated to be up 30 percent this year and the audio-visual conference rooms/smart home business up a projected 100 percent, said Oh.\\n\\n\"We could never increase our business as an Apple independent retailer by 100 percent; the business and the marketplace were never there,\" he said. \"I am happy I am out of that market, and that loss forced me to reevaluate and focus on the core business, which makes money.\"',\n",

       "    'title': \"Editorial: Apple's impact from social distancing in 2020 - iPhone Discussions on AppleInsider Forums\",\n",
       "    'body': 'Just a few months ago, Apple was gearing up to climb onto the gigantic shoulders of its blockbuster iPhone 11 launch to deliver another massive annual upgrade to its Macs, iPads, audio devices, wearables, and the upcoming new iPhone 12. Then the world ground to a halt in an unprecedented way. Here\\'s how Apple can make the most positive impact possible in this year of social distancing.\\n\\nI initially started writing a piece about Apple\\'s biggest flaws that it needed address this year: solvable problems the company needed to fix to greatly improve its current offerings beyond just the release of new technologies such as LIDAR-enhanced Augmented Reality, Ultrawideband AirTags, new camera sensors and lenses, and all of the other expected enhancements to its OS software.\\n\\nMy list of necessary and deliverable 2020 fixes included things like Apple working to radically revamp its language tools to fix the increasingly glaring and frustrating errors in QuickType autocorrect-- which seems to have devolved from being nearly magical into an annoying hindrance over the past few years. My list of rough edges ranged from elements of computational photography to iCloud to search and Siri to AirPlay 2 minutia.\\n\\nInstead, the larger issues of 2020 landed with a thud that made my various grievances seem downright petty. On top of that, I got sick and limped along feeling at least a taste of how miserable and overwhelming it is to fall ill while also isolated. To people who are much more seriously ill, or for whom isolation is even more devastating to their economic security, the wishlist for what appears to be the world\\'s most competent orchestrator of supply chains and product development has shifted dramatically. Remarkably, Apple already appears to have expertly positioned itself to deal with the COVID-19 crisis long before anyone conceived of a global pandemic occurring this year. Despite contemptuous protest from a flock of know-nothing columnists who spent 2019 nodding along to the absolutely braindead idea that Apple has sadly lost the twinkling design-based magic of Steve Jobs and Jonny Ive under the \"boringly operational\" reign of Tim Cook, the reality has been very different.\\n\\nCook\\'s operational foresight in building a global supply chain in partnership with the most competent leaders in fabrication and assembly-- ranging from TSMC to Foxconn-- has resulted in an agile, flexible and extremely powerful structure that can literally build anything, faster, better, and stronger than any dreamed up \"factory in America\" or any other imagined plant conveniently situated in a populist hotbed of overconfident nationalist supremacy rooted in a glorious industrial past that doesn\\'t exist anymore.\\n\\nAfter decrying Apple for being hopelessly stuck in China rather than reliably building stuff \"at home,\" the tables have turned on the facile opinions of Wall Street Journal bloggers, revealing instead that Apple\\'s global supply chain and production network in Asia is already almost back to normal, while the United States only freshly begins its devolution into absolute chaos, completely unprepared for a pandemic crisis.\\n\\nApple\\'s retail stores in China are already opening far in advance of the incremental reopening scheduled for the future of its locations outside of China. Despite Apple\\'s ambitious sounding plans, that might take significant time to occur in places like New York City, where COVID-19 interruptions are paralyzing normal life and will clearly continue for an unknown, extended period of time. Yet it\\'s noteworthy that Apple is moving ambitiously if also cautiously, rather than just blaming its troubles on a country that is still deeply divided on whether the global pandemic is actually a hoax or not, and whether doctors really know what they are doing or not, or if people should self medicate with colloidal silver and fish tank chemicals or not. Additionally, Apple has already demonstrated its fast, flexible operational supply chain muscle, rapidly flexing its power to produce desperately needed Personal Protective Equipment for healthcare workers, including millions of disposable masks to protect the doctors, nurses, and other emergency care workers on the frontline of this disaster.\\n\\nIt has certainly helped that Apple isn\\'t just freshly approaching the healthcare industry for the first time. The company has been working closely with hospitals and universities for years to develop its ResearchKit and CareKit tools, gaining an intimate understanding of the issues and needs of healthcare institutions. Apple has even been operating its own health care clinics scattered around its various campuses.\\n\\nApple\\'s connection to healthcare is so strong, in fact, that Cook presciently stated in January 2019 that \"If you zoom out into the future, and you look back, and you ask the question, What was Apple\\'s greatest contribution to mankind?\\' It will be about health.\" In retrospect, that thought might have seemed excessive a year ago. Today it appears that Apple was cultivating deep insights into the most important subjects to humanity that all of its embittered newspaper critics simply failed to actually appreciate or even grasp.\\n\\nIn the company\\'s latest conference call-- back when COVID-19 was only expected to pose some short term complications-- even Apple\\'s chief financial officer Luca Maestri made significant comments about Apple\\'s exposure and influence on healthcare as an industry, emphasizing how important of an impact the company was having in the realm of healthcare.\\n\\n\"100% of Fortune 500 companies in the healthcare sector use Apple technology in areas such as patient experience, clinical communications and nursing workflows,\" Maestri stated, \"and we\\'re also seeing smaller companies in this sector drive innovation with our technology and apps. One example is Gauss Surgical, which uses CoreML in iOS to more accurately estimate blood loss during childbirth and surgery. This helps clinicians have more complete and timely information on whether a patient needs an intervention, which can impact both clinical outcomes and cost. Another example is Butterfly Network, a medical imaging company which makes a handheld ultrasound device that connects to iPhone or iPad to enable clinicians to take ultrasound anywhere at a cost that is dramatically lower than other solutions in the market today.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s easy to take healthcare for granted until you get wheeled into an emergency room with some sort of severe condition or injury. Yet Apple\\'s business model of making the best possible devices in massive scale naturally lends itself to finding and solving important and vitally valuable tasks: like keeping us alive, informed and safe. The business model of Google\\'s Android platform does not. It coasts along seeking to achieve mediocracy at minimal expense to enable the low-cost tracking of consumer behaviors to deliver commercial advertising messages at the highest profit, without any real regard for whether those ad messages are even true or just completely fraudulent and manipulatively profiteering.\\n\\nThat\\'s why Apple\\'s successes have been its latest iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple Watch and other wearables, while Android has largely powered cheap phones barely capable of running significant apps as well as WiFi microphones that have failed to deliver enough value to consumers to warrant anything more than a $30 loss leader impulse buy of gimmicky curiosity. Yet which approach are columnist critics wholeheartedly advocating, and which are they incessantly complaining about? Note that Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, and so on weren\\'t ever chiding Apple for failing to enter the healthcare market in a significant way. Instead, they were belaboring the idea that Apple shouldn\\'t be so concerned about Operations and instead should be blowing smoke up journalists\\' skirts about gimmicks like folding OLED panels and not-yet-ready 5G mobile networks, two of the least important factors in consumer electronics to matter across all of 2019, despite constant infomercials from Apple agitators wondering why there was no 5G iPhone that could be bent in half for the premium price of $2,600 or more. They beat that drum as if they were being paid to do it.\\n\\nAlso recall how these same voices of concern earlier spent 2018 grousing about what a disappointing failure iPhone X would be because of how terribly expensive it was at $999; or who talked in 2017 about what a terrible mess Apple TV 4K was because they had no vision for what Apple could deliver purely in software updates for its now solid TV+ and Arcade platform; or who spent 2016 wondering aloud why Apple hadn\\'t jumped on the bandwagon of Virtual Reality headsets, the fantasy that ended up being the biggest loser of that year.\\n\\nIt\\'s almost as if prolific anti-Apple pundits like Tripp Mickle, Joana Stern, and Mark Gurman have no insight into the things Apple is doing that are really important, and nothing but hollow, ignorant concerns for all of the failed things competitors are doing that Apple is deftly avoiding. The best explanation is that these writers who are commissioned to craft contemptuous cacophonies of complaints really have no idea what is going on or what is important. They are mercenaries of empty outrage in a war on competency.\\n\\nNotice also how none of them-- and let\\'s include all the market research groups-- had any vision to see where Apple Watch was going over the last several years. None saw how it would grow into a product that could monitor accidents and falls or underlying heart issues, or play an increasingly large role in collecting personal health data useful for everything from clinical trials and medical treatments to exercise, activity, and mensuration-- all without relying on some sort of invasive advertising-based business model.\\n\\nInstead, they groused for years about how Apple Watch wasn\\'t immediately a bigger launch spectacle than iPhone itself, a bizarrely safe claim that ended up looking as dumb as everything else they\\'ve ever written about how woefully incompetent and totally scatterbrained and ineffectual Apple is as a company. Why can\\'t Apple just get evenhanded treatment that involves measured criticism and appropriate credit for what it does? Because every one of these writers and research groups is playing to the web advertising networks that thrive on outrage \"engagement,\" where the simple truth is just too boring to sell ads. Suggest to readers that they are smart for agreeing with how dumb Apple is and they line up to view ads, just to feel better about themselves. They\\'re smarter than Tim Cook! They know everything Apple should be doing, and here is a blogger agreeing with them about how super clever they are, even though they actually accomplish nothing of value. Rather than constant outrage and smug, hollow engagement that keeps everyone perpetually upset, cynical, and terrified, what the world really needs is practical, competent, and uncontroversial strides in scientific progress and policy delivered by operational planners with a history of successful accomplishment. The jury is still out on whether than can happen on a national level, but Apple as a company is already showing how to do that.\\n\\nApple\\'s goals for 2020 are certainly going to be impacted by COVID-19. WWDC20 has already been converted to an online format, and Apple appears to have sprung out its LIDAR future for instant ARKit early, revealing what will be one of the showcase features of this year\\'s iPhone 12. It\\'s pretty clearly another step in the direction of augmented computer vision, preparing to make the jump from device display to wearable lens. It\\'s what\\'s ready and possible now, and Apple\\'s frameworks are what developers can build upon now to prepare for an even more advanced future.\\n\\nApple has also begun using its platforms to draw attention to reliable information right now. Siri, the App Store, and Apple News are all featuring professional, expert advice on social distancing from the CDC. Core Apple technologies including iMessage and FaceTime are making it easy-- and free-- for individuals to securely connect with friends, family, and business colleagues while practicing social distancing.\\n\\nApple\\'s big push last year to drive Services, from Apple Arcade, to News+, to TV+ and its Apple TV platform of channels, were all widely disparaged by talking heads proclaiming that Apple was \"pivoting from hardware\" and other nonsense, while also insisting that Apple was impossibly behind Netflix and Roku and whatever other false comparisons they could throw out. Yet instead, Apple managed to launch and refine these offerings just before it got the \"perfect storm\" of captive audiences: millions of users stuck at home looking for news, entertainment, new content, and alternatives to ad-based cable. Apple TV is not without flaws, but it has rapidly shifted from an \"other product\" into a very desirable, high-quality way to enjoy content from any service, including Netflix, Disney+ and other offerings.\\n\\nArcade is, in particular, a strong new showing for the App Store that has radically shifted casual gaming from annoying In-App shovelware into a real, viable market for a creative array of different kinds of gaming, titles that can appeal to new kinds of players as well as delivering a broad selection of classic gameplay that spans from mobile device to TV to the Mac. Arcade has barely been around for several months, yet has dramatically improved the quality of games parents can put in front of their kids without having to worry about security issues or ringing up a big bill of loot boxes and virtual coins. It\\'s an incredible success, delivered simply by identifying an ambitious goal and then working to achieve it with development partners.\\n\\nThe world didn\\'t seem to grasp where Apple was going with Apple Pay and last year\\'s debut of Apple Card. But both have positioned the company perfectly to take the greatest advantage of a new world where handling money is yet another risk. Tap to pay transactions, with details right on your phone, are not only broadly available globally now, but retailers have increased motivation to accept NFC payments. Further, in offering its customers credit and new iPhone financing, Apple is in a position to help them get back on their feet financially, with payment forgiveness and the ability to buy what they need now. Apple Card also integrates Apple Business Chat for customer service, an offering Apple\\'s critics have rarely addressed.\\n\\nApple\\'s launch of macOS Catalina last fall was appropriately criticized for its rough edges, but now that the company has addressed its biggest flaws, the new release has shifted iTunes into a more coherent batch of media apps and made users\\' existing hardware more valuable, as seen with iOS Sketch and iPad Sidecar.\\n\\nJust a few weeks ago, a spectrum of pundits was telling us how Apple had totally screwed up the iPad over the past decade, failing in its multitasking, its mouse support, and well, everything about it that wasn\\'t a \"real PC.\" But now that most of us in the world\\'s population centers are working remotely due to the coronavirus pandemic, the genius of iPad is starting to manifest itself in a striking fashion. After a decade of maturing, iPad is perfectly ready for the remote-optimized, highly simplified computing needed in the Coronavirus era.\\n\\nOn a lower level, the work Apple has done in highly integrated silicon has resulted in Apple itself being the leading producer of high-end mobile chips, ranging from the beast chips that power iPad Pro to the copilot chips that bring iOS features to modern Macs, to the one-piece computers that power Apple Watch and the ultra-slim silicon that drives AirPods.\\n\\nThis year, while we start out 2020 stuck inside and working largely in isolation, the world should take a cue from the proficient, wildly competent, incremental progress Apple has consistently delivered over the past decades under the restrained fanfare generated by Cook and his executive team.\\n\\nThere are no extravagant banners draped over the once-common idea of trade shows extolling some flashy new hardware gimmick, or simply touting a brand like Android or Windows that doesn\\'t really consistency stand for anything. Just the incremental, science-based improvements that have driven Apple into position as the world\\'s most competent consumer electronics company.\\n\\nApple is not run by populist opinion or fueled by carefully tracked engagements of outrage. It\\'s driven by delivering products that are so consistently high quality that people show up to vote with their dollars to advance this progress.\\n\\nThat\\'s something we need to see across every facet of society, not just screaming ads that bellow out hollow ideas of greatness and ridicule the people who actually achieve progress.',\n",

       "    'body': 'Everything you need to know about buying AAPL shares including all the research you should do before you buy, how to find out the P/E Ratio, reasons to buy Apple stock, reasons to avoid Apple shares and more\\n\\nIn this article we guide you through the pros and cons of investing in Apple, explain how to buy Apple shares, assess what affects the value of AAPL, and examine who owns Apple shares.\\n\\nIf you were to invest in Apple you would effectively become a joint-owner of the company and, along with all the other shareholders, you would have a say in the decisions the company makes.\\n\\nAs a reward, your investment could grow as the company enjoys successes. You will also benefit from a share in the profits of the company in the form of dividend payments every quarter.\\n\\nHowever the value of your investment can also decline. Tying your money to the success of any company is risky business. Should you take the risk with Apple?\\n\\nTo find out is how much Apple shares are worth at the moment click here.\\n\\nShould you buy Apple shares?\\n\\nThis is a big question that only you can answer. First things first: Apple\\'s share price is incredibly volatile. Don\\'t invest if you want to make a quick buck. And definitely don\\'t invest if you can\\'t afford to lose your money.\\n\\nThere are a few things to consider:\\n\\nIs it a short term or long term investment?\\n\\nOver the long term it should be possible for investors to make money out of Apple stock.\\n\\nIf you are hoping to make a fast buck with a short term investment then we wouldn\\'t usually recommend Apple. The people who make short term gains on Apple are the big funds who plough millions into the stock only to take it out again a few months later (more on them below).\\n\\nCan you afford to invest in AAPL?\\n\\nApple shares aren\\'t cheap, but they are a lot more affordable than they were before the 7:1 split in 2014. Back in September 2013 you\\'d have had to pay $700 a share. Now you can buy a share of Apple for a lot less (as of 12 March 2020 it was $275.43 a share but it has been as much as $327.85).\\n\\nEven if that price sounds ok to you, you will need to factor in other costs of owning shares:\\n\\nYou will need to pay fees to your broker. You may have to pay Stamp Duty when you buy. When you sell the shares you may have to pay Capital Gains Tax. If you are buying shares that are based on an exchange in another country you will have to pay tax there too.\\n\\nThe other big question to consider is: Can you afford to lose your money?\\n\\nYou should only invest in Apple if you don\\'t mind the fact that you could lose some of your money. As with any stock market investment, you can lose as well as gain money.\\n\\nIs there a better way to make money?\\n\\nLow interest rates mean the rates of interest offered by many straightforward investments right now are very low. For example, the best ISAs only offer around 1.65% interest. If you have money to invest you may think that the promise of a much a bigger percentage increase on Apple shares is much more attractive. Then again, you could also see a loss in the value of your investment.\\n\\nThere are plenty of other less volatile stocks to consider if trading was something you wanted to get into. However, in the current climate (as of March 2020) any exchange is likely to be effected by Coronovirus fears so as we said above any investment you make should be considered long term as we don\\'t know how long this economic decline will last.\\n\\nAre you an Apple fan?\\n\\nKey to your decision of whether to invest may be that you are an Apple fan with good knowledge in the company, and an interest in Apple that means that you follow the highs and lows of the company with interest. Nobody can predict the future, but at least you have good knowledge of what happened in the past.\\n\\nIs now a good time to buy Apple shares?\\n\\nThe next factor to consider is whether now is a good time to buy AAPL. We\\'ll discuss whether it\\'s a good time to buy Apple in more detail below.\\n\\nPlease keep in mind that we are not financial experts and also that the situation will be changing all the time. From one day to the next there could be various reasons why Apple would be, or wouldn\\'t be, a good buy. We recommend that you do a considerable amount of research before buying AAPL shares - but we aim to give you some guidance below as to what you should try to find out.\\n\\nHere are a few things to consider before buying AAPL shares:\\n\\nPrice to earnings ratio\\n\\nThe PE ratio is the valuation ratio of a company\\'s current share price compared to its per-share earnings (over the past 12 months).\\n\\nYou can check Apple\\'s P/E Ratio here.\\n\\nHistorically the average P/E Ratio on the S&P 500 has been between 13 and 15. If the P/E Ratio is higher than that it indicates that investors expect good earnings.\\n\\nNote that tech companies like Apple tend to have higher P/E ratios due to growth expectations in the future.\\n\\nHowever, if it\\'s lower than that it\\'s not necessarily a bad buy because a high P/E could just mean that the stock is overvalued.\\n\\nAnalyst recommendations\\n\\nMost analysts in the spring of 2020 were giving Apple a Strong Buy rating, but in turbulent times this recommendation could change so our recommendation is that you find out what analysts are saying at the time you are considering buying.\\n\\nYou can see the consensus recommendation for AAPL here. That link will also give you guidance on which analysts are or aren\\'t recommending AAPL and their average price target for the company (and the low estimate).\\n\\nApple\\'s health\\n\\nAs revealed in its financial report at the end of December 2019, Apple has more than $207.06 billion in reserves - this is a good buffer in a tough economic climate.\\n\\nApple\\'s late CEO and Co-Founder Steve Jobs once said that during the downturn of 2008 Apple increased spend on research and development so that Apple would be ahead of the competition once the downturn was over. We can assume that Apple will be doing the same during the current (2020) economic downturn.\\n\\nThat\\'s not the most money Apple has had in its coffers though. The company had $163 billion at one point in 2017. It\\'s not a bad thing that that Apple has been spending some of its enormous cash reserves though. Apple has made investments in acquisitions or companies and technologies and investors have benefitted from Stock Buybacks (more on that below).\\n\\nApple\\'s plans for the future\\n\\nThere have been concerns that Apple is too dependent on the iPhone.\\n\\nIn recent years Apple has been mitigating some of its reliance on the iPhone by expanding its services offerings including the App Stores, Apple Music, Apple TV+ and more.\\n\\nThe next thing on the horizon is 5G, and that could help boost iPhone sales later in the year when the company is expected to launch a 5G iPhone.\\n\\nThe company is also thought to have a number of top secret projects underway that relate to cars and augmented reality. While Apple may never again make the kind of impact it made with the launch of the iPhone, you can be sure that it is making investments in the next big thing.\\n\\nIf you feel confident that Apple will keep innovating into the future then it could be a good investment for you.\\n\\nChina\\n\\nIt\\'s not only the iPhone that Apple\\'s been criticised for being too reliant on. Apple is also thought to be too dependent on China for manufacturing the iPhone and its other hardware. Business in China also represents something like 20% of Apple\\'s revenue.\\n\\nEven before Coronavirus closed Apple\\'s Chinese factories in February 2020 China had already impacted Apple\\'s share price.\\n\\nAs you will see from this chart tracking AAPL over the past ten years, Apple has climbed but there have been dips. There was a dip that began at the end of October 2018 (partly due to concerns about iPhone sales and Apple\\'s decision to stop reporting numbers, but also relating to US/China trade tensions and falling iPhone sales there).\\n\\nThen the price started to recover in Jan 2019 before another dip in April 2019 (this time due to Trump\\'s decision to increase Chinese tariffs). And then the dip in February 2020 (which was due to Coronavirus and the manufacturing delays in China.)\\n\\nApple might be an American company but it\\'s success is linked to China and what is happening there, so keep an eye on China-related news before buying AAPL stock.\\n\\nDon\\'t believe everything you read\\n\\nIf you are serious about your investment you must take any reports claiming to have an insight into what Apple has up its sleeve, or claims that Apple\\'s share price will hit $1,000 with a pinch of salt.\\n\\nNobody has a crystal ball so don\\'t believe reports that claim to be able to predict what will happen over time. It\\'s nice that people have faith in the stock (some of the time) but they may well have ulterior motives in getting you to invest your money. As Asymco\\'s Horace Dediu said back in 2013: \"The opinion of those who are highly paid should be treated with suspicion.\" Be wary of analysts who work for financial services, noted Dediu, their paychecks \"are not tied to accuracy of foresight\".\\n\\nUnfortunately, reports based on the words of these analysts and other so called experts, along with supposed \"leaks\" from the Far East, may cause changes to the value of the stock. Apple\\'s stock has been known to soar or plummet on completely unfounded rumours and speculation.\\n\\nOther benefits to buying Apple Shares\\n\\nAside from the promise of being able to make some money based on your investment there are a few other benefits of owning Apple Shares.\\n\\nStock BuyBacks and Dividends\\n\\nApple pays a quarterly dividend to its investors. The decision to pay out a dividend was a response to investors calling for Apple to distribute some of its stash of money, but it\\'s questionable that it\\'s a real bonus to investors.\\n\\nBefore you get too excited, the dividend doesn\\'t add up to much if you only own a few Apple shares, but it can add up if you have a few shares.\\n\\nThe other problem with dividends is you will get taxed on the money.\\n\\nHow do I buy Apple shares?\\n\\nIf having considered all of the above you want to buy Apple Shares here\\'s what you need to know.\\n\\nShares can be bought and sold by post, telephone or online. It\\'s incredibly easy to buy and sell shares via the internet, plus it\\'s often the cheapest option.\\n\\nNote that internet share dealing is execution only. This means that the broker carries out your instructions on what to buy and sell without giving you any advice.\\n\\nIt is also likely your shares will be held in a nominee account - basically the stockbroker holds them on your behalf. This means your name may not appear on the company\\'s register - and as a result you may not receive the company\\'s financial report and you probably won\\'t be able to vote. Dividends will still be paid into your account however.\\n\\nYour internet share dealing services might buy and sell shares in real time so you know exactly the price you are paying for your chosen shares, but it is also possible that shares are purchased at certain times of the day, so you may not be buying at the price you thought you were.\\n\\nAnother thing to note is that if you don\\'t hold the share certificates, you will have to sell the shares through the broker you bought them from. You will likely be charged a fee if you swap to another firm.\\n\\nYou can also invest through a stockbroker. You may have to pay them commission, but it is still possible to opt for an instant access execution-only stockbroker, who won\\'t give you advice and simply process your requested transactions.\\n\\nYou can also make your share transactions through an investment ISA (in the UK). That way you can save up to a certain amount every year, tax free.\\n\\nBuying AAPL shares in the UK\\n\\nIf you are based in the UK there are some extra steps necessary before you can buy Apple stock. If you have never traded in US shares before, you will need to fill in the W-8BEN form and you will need to resubmit it every few years. This confirms your foreign status for tax purposes.\\n\\nIf you are thinking of buying Apple shares get this form filled in now so that you can buy shares on the day you choose, not days later because you weren\\'t prepared.\\n\\nWhat does it cost to buy shares?\\n\\nIn the UK when you buy shares, you pay 0.5% stamp duty on top of the cost of dealing.\\n\\nAny dividend income is also subject to tax. As of 2019/2020 the dividend ordinary rate of 20% applies for basic rate taxpayers who earn up to £37,500 , a rate of 40% if you earn up to £150,000 and 45% if you earn more than that.\\n\\nWhen you receive dividend payments a percentage of tax has already been paid, and it will appear on your dividend voucher as a tax credit and may mean that as a basic rate taxpayer you have no further tax to pay. If on the other hand you are a higher rate taxpayer you will have an outstanding tax liability to pay when you make your tax return. There\\'s lots of information about this here.\\n\\nThere\\'s also capital gains tax to consider. If you sell your Apple share for more money than you bought it for, you will have made a capital gain and it will be liable to tax at a rate of 10%, or 20% for higher rate tax payers. Before any tax is payable though, you have an annual tax-free allowance for Capital Gains Tax, which is £12,000 for the 2019/20 tax year. Read more here.\\n\\nAn exception to these tax rules is dividends from ISAs, which are tax-free.\\n\\nFor bigger investors there\\'s also a mandatory £1 to the takeover panel (PTM) for all trades worth more than £10,000.\\n\\nAnother way to save money is to deal with electronic share certificates. They are a lot less costly than dealing in paper share certificates.\\n\\nWe\\'re not investment advisors so we don\\'t recommend any particular brokers. There is this article about investing on the MoneySavingExpert site that might be useful. Or look here at this comparison of UK share dealing accounts.\\n\\nOn the next page you will find some more information, but note we haven\\'t updated it since we wrote it in 2014. We are leaving it as a case study indicating the kinds of things that can go on behind the scenes with Apple\\'s shares.',\n",

       "    'body': 'Apple used to be about changing the world one magic box at a time. Now it\\'s fighting to conquer TV drama, healthcare, money, news and much else besides\\n\\nForty-five feels like half way. You\\'re not old, but neither are you in the first flush of youth. It\\'s a good time for a review, to take stock. That\\'s exactly what Tim Cook is doing at Apple, the firm he runs, as it approaches its 45th birthday.\\n\\nWhat he sees through the glass walls of the company\\'s $5 billion (£3.9bn) flying-saucer-like headquarters in Cupertino, California, is a behemoth that has never been more valuable. Apple\\'s stock price more than doubled last year; by January 2020, the company was worth $1.4 trillion, more than all the companies in the Dax index of Germany\\'s top 30 combined.\\n\\nYet his business has never looked more complex, hard to manage and prone to risk. It not only has to live up to its absurdly high standards and invent and re-invent the next new thing, it is heading into uncharted waters. Critics and fans alike are asking: does it know what it is any more? Is it playing to its strengths - or spreading itself too thin?\\n\\n\"This is an odd period in our history,\" says one Apple executive, speaking privately. \"We\\'re trying all sorts of stuff. Some very \\'Appley\\' - like AirPods. Others are very established, like TV shows. It\\'s a big change from doing one \\'think different\\' thing at a time.\"\\n\\nCook\\'s diversification reflects the market. The rapid transformation of consumer tech means keeping customers engaged is far more complex than when Steve Jobs was running things, with his design chief, Jony Ive, at his side. Apple is \"operating at a breadth and depth we\\'ve never operated at before\", Cook says.\\n\\nTake hardware as an example: to add to the Jobs-and-Ive-inspired Mac computers, iPad and iPhone, Apple now sells watches and AirPods. Augmented reality (AR) glasses, and virtual reality and AR headsets for gaming and virtual meetings, are rumoured. To make sure users remain tethered to Apple devices, and to add new revenue streams, Cook is launching new services as varied as original drama on Apple TV+, available on Apple TV; a \"news you can trust\" service; financial services in a joint venture with Goldman Sachs; and healthcare, exploiting the heart-rate and other sensors in the Apple Watch.\\n\\nCook also has the issues that now afflict every big tech outfit, including those in Russia and China, where he faces both political issues and the effects of COVID-19 on production and consumption of iPhones and iPads, both made in China. Apple is also battling the EU\\'s $15bn fine for its tax structures. And he has to do it all without two key executives who helped to make Apple Apple: Ive and head of retail Angela Ahrendts quit in 2019.\\n\\nStill, Cook has plenty of reasons to be cheerful. Apple\\'s core business - making and selling expensive hardware - is booming. Despite a wobbly 2018, iPhone sales rose to $56bn during the fourth quarter of 2019, up eight per cent over the year. A 5G handset, expected in September, will further boost sales.\\n\\nAirPods, wireless in-ear headphones with built-in sensors and a voice-assistant, are a bona fide hit. Dan Ives, of investment firm Wedbush Securities, says they are the fastest growing of all Apple\\'s products, with profit margins above 50 per cent. With the noise-cancelling AirPods Pro - around $250 a pair - Ives reckons Apple\\'s earware may generate up to $15 billion of sales in 2020, and could become the company\\'s third-largest product by revenue in 2021.\\n\\nAfter a slow start, the Apple Watch is ticking along nicely. Apple is now the largest watchmaker in the world by revenue, outselling the entire Swiss watch industry, analysis by Strategy Analytics suggests. It estimates Apple shipped 31 million units in 2019, a 36 per cent rise on 2018, compared with 21 million units for the venerable Swiss brands. Year on year, Apple\\'s total company revenue, from all hardware and services, rose nine per cent in the last quarter of 2019 to $91.8 billion, an all-time quarterly record.\\n\\nAway from products and services, Cook has navigated the \"techlash\" better than any other big tech CEO. He has deftly turned the sector\\'s most contentious social and political issue - privacy - into a competitive advantage. He rarely misses an opportunity to condemn his Silicon Valley neighbours, notably Google and Facebook, for a business model based on harvesting and monetising their users\\' personal information - which Apple does not do.\\n\\nOn the world stage, Cook has avoided the ire of Beijing and, as a result, prospers in the world\\'s largest consumer electronics market. The firm enjoyed sales of $44 billion in China during the 12-month period ending in June 2019, analysts say. China, Hong Kong and Taiwan constitute Apple\\'s second-largest market after the US. Back home, Cook has a working relationship with Donald Trump, despite their contrasting personalities and opposing views on many issues (and the president\\'s mangling of his name: he has called Cook \"Tim Apple\"). It has paid rich dividends: Trump has spared iPhones, iPads, and other products from the stiff tariffs that have affected other goods imported into the US from China.\\n\\nBut that is where the unalloyed good news ends. Apple\\'s push into new services takes the firm outside its core area of excellence - premium hardware. In each new market it faces tough, established and well-resourced competitors, which means Cook has little chance of repeating the usual Apple trick of waiting until the time is right to perfect a product that is already out there, and doing it so well it instantly destroys the competition.\\n\\nIn music there\\'s Spotify and Amazon Music. Apple Music has performed well, attracting 60 million subscribers, but Spotify leads the market with 124 million. Subscription growth in news has been sluggish, Apple insiders concede, because it is battling every big publisher on the planet. In TV, there\\'s Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, AT&T\\'s HBO Max, Viacom\\'s BET+, NBCUniversal\\'s Peacock and Britbox, which offers the best of UK programmes to viewers in the US, Canada and the United Kingdom. Netflix enjoys more than 165 million subscribers and a content budget of $17 billion a year.\\n\\nRegardless, Apple is taking TV seriously. Cook has lured big names - Jennifer Aniston, Steve Carell, Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, former HBO CEO Richard Plepler, ex-Sony Pictures Television execs Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, and the film-maker JJ Abrams to its service, but Hollywood\\'s magic has failed to cast a spell on consumers. Apple hasn\\'t released subscriber stats for TV+, but Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi claims that fewer than ten million opted for the free 12-month trial Apple offered. This is at most ten per cent of eligible customers, a take-up rate he describes as \"surprisingly low\". Disney+ netted 28.6 million subscribers in its first three months.\\n\\nApple is stumbling in other new markets. Cook may have lured John Giannandrea from Google to become Apple\\'s head of AI and machine learning, but the firm remains \"behind\" on AI, says Vishal Sikka, former chief executive of IT services group Infosys. Take digital voice assistants. Despite pioneering the \"online butler\" with Siri, Apple has found itself outflanked by Amazon\\'s Alexa and Google Assistant in both ease of use and smart speaker sales. It takes vast amounts of personal data to perfect voice recognition and other AI, which suits Amazon and Google, since they harvest everything we do, everywhere we do it. Apple\\'s strict privacy strategy ties its hands.\\n\\nTwo areas where its commitment to privacy might be a competitive advantage are healthcare and financial services. Apple\\'s Health Kit integrates data from multiple wearable devices, enabling care teams to spot - or even predict - illness. Can a move into health insurance be far behind? The Apple (credit) Card, launched in August 2019 with Goldman Sachs, works well with the increasingly popular Apple Pay, and also exists as a physical titanium credit card. Apple could use it to expand further in financial services, a market in which the other tech giants are likely to struggle.\\n\\nNo one in their right mind would trust Mark Zuckerberg with their cash - as the consumer and regulatory backlash against Facebook\\'s proposed Libra global cryptocurrency confirms. Apple Pay already accounts for about five per cent of global credit card transactions, and that number is set to double by 2025, recent trend data compiled by Bernstein, a research firm, shows. Apple services, which includes Pay, generated revenues of $12.7bn in the last three months of last year, up almost 20 per cent year on year, analysts say. Digital payments are an immense market opportunity, worth $1 trillion a year in global revenue.\\n\\nChina may be a commercial success for Apple, but it is beginning to look like a reputational risk - and a threat to Apple\\'s self-anointed role as patron saint of privacy. Last year, at the request of Beijing, Apple began storing data and keys to Chinese iCloud accounts at a data centre in China. Privacy advocates say that doing so makes it easier for the Chinese authorities to monitor what Apple consumers do in the country. The Chinese App Store no longer offers the New York Times app, as well as many leading virtual private networks that can be used to leap the Chinese censor\\'s Great Firewall. In Hong Kong, Apple removed from the App Store HKmap.live, which pro-democracy protesters used to track police activity, after China\\'s state-run newspapers published articles criticising it.\\n\\nAs pro-democracy demonstrations in the territory continue, how long can Apple avoid the problems that have long affected Google in its efforts to prosper in China? Google last year cancelled plans to create a censored search engine for China after staff revolted. The stakes are higher for Apple than any other tech outfit, since it cannot pull out of China because of its iPhone and iPad factories there.\\n\\nApple could face political heat for its Russia policies, too. Starting late last year, Apple\\'s Maps and Weather apps, when used in Russia, have denoted the Crimea peninsula, Ukrainian territory illegally annexed by Russia in 2014, as Russian. Apple argues it \"can best promote fundamental rights, including the right of free expression, by being engaged even where we may disagree with a particular country\\'s law\".\\n\\nWhile it battles reputational issues in Russia and China, Apple\\'s performance in other new growth markets, notably India and Africa, remains weak. Cheaper Android handsets, often made by Chinese rivals Xiaomi and Huawei, dominate emerging markets. Perhaps the new, cheaper, entry-level iPhone which will be launched soon will help.\\n\\nCook faces broader questions, too. The departure of Ive and his right-hand man Marc Newson raises again the issue that has dogged Cook ever since he took over from Jobs in 2011: can Apple create a revolutionary successor to the iPod, iPhone and iPad - a product or service that within days of launch, consumers around the world decide they must have? Project Titan, Apple\\'s autonomous car, has failed to gain traction. The Apple Watch is an undoubted sales success, but it pales in comparison to iPhones or iPads.\\n\\nSome say Apple\\'s latest launches show it is losing its desire to \"put a ding in the universe\", as Jobs loved to say. Does Cook \"want to sell prestige TV for the rest of his life, or does he want to change the world?\" Farhad Manjoo, of the New York Times, asks pointedly. Why, Manjoo goes on, has Apple failed to create an ad-free Instagram, new privacy-minded versions of social media services, or a YouTube \"that isn\\'t a haven for neo-Nazis\"? Such big ideas \"match in scope and daring what Apple was created to do\" and would complement Apple\\'s privacy-first USP.\\n\\nOthers are more optimistic. Apple\\'s push into new services may seem risky, but they point out the firm has been here before. When it faced bankruptcy in the late 1990s, Jobs reinvented the company by developing services with new devices: the iPod and iTunes revived a firm that was largely dependent on computer sales. \"What Cook is trying to do is come up with a new set of iTunes-like services to mate with more varied hardware to create an ecosystem that is simple and compelling,\" says one Apple veteran. \"Imagine secure communications, iCloud storage, TV, quality news, banking, health, insurance and more, all from the same, trusted supplier on iPhone, iPad, Mac, the Watch and, in future, AR glasses. That would be pretty revolutionary.\" And profitable. Such a bundle could command subscription fees of more than £100 a month, analysts say.\\n\\nNo Apple story would be complete without a healthy dollop of speculation. So... we can exclusively reveal (perhaps) that the firm is working on an iPhone 4-like handset with a stainless steel band around the case; new cameras that capture greater depth information to help with augmented reality; an iPad Pro with 3D cameras; Macs abandoning Intel processors for Apple-made chips, which could presage a move into the chip market; and satellites that will beam internet signals to Earth.\\n\\nPresident Xi, Jennifer Aniston, Hong Kong protesters, self-driving cars, the loss of two star strikers, deep space, Russian imperialism and a missing mojo - it makes the hit HBO show Succession sound like a documentary, and would be just the drama to take on Apple TV+. Over to you, Netflix.',\n",

       "    'body': 'The Apple Watch 3 (left), Apple Watch 4 and Apple Watch 5 (right) (Image credit: Apple)\\n\\nDonning an Apple Watch in 2020 is a little more tempting with all the deals, fresh features, the watchOS 6 update, and a higher app count. It\\'s a fantastic smartwatch series, as long as you\\'re happy with an iPhone-tied convenience gadget - don\\'t expect a life-changing piece of technology.\\n\\nWhy? Two versions of the watch makes our best smartwatch list, but smartwatches aren\\'t game-changing tech like smartphones were when they burst onto the scene over a decade ago. Instead, smartwatches are just an everyday awesome add-on, a true accessory that makes everything you do with a smartphone just a little better.\\n\\nApple never ended up calling this the \\'iWatch\\', but it really is \"my watch\" - with all its iterations the company has proved this is Apple\\'s most personal and customizable gadget yet.\\n\\nWe\\'ve put together the guide below to talk you through the differences between all six iterations of the Apple Watch. There\\'s the original Apple Watch, the Apple Watch Series 1, Apple Watch Series 2, Apple Watch Series 3, Apple Watch Series 4, and now, the Apple Watch Series 5.\\n\\nIt\\'s a complicated mix of smartwatches now, with over 100 different flavors once you factor in the variety of case materials, colors, sizes and interchangeable Apple Watch bands, so there are a bunch of a tough decisions to make. That\\'s not even getting into the fact that we\\'re expecting an Apple Watch 6 later in 2020. But let\\'s start with the big question: which is the best Apple Watch for you?\\n\\nOS: watchOS 6 | Compatibility: iOS | Display: 1.57\" / 1.78\" OLED | Processor: Apple S5 | Band sizes: Varies based on watch size | Onboard storage: 32GB | Battery: Up to 18 hours | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: Water-resistant to 50m | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, LTE\\n\\nThe Apple Watch 5 was unveiled in September 2019, and it\\'s the most high-tech device from the company\\'s wearable line yet. It isn\\'t a huge upgrade over the Apple Watch 4, but this latest version comes with an always-on display for the first time.\\n\\nThat will allow you to see all of your key stats without having to turn on your watch\\'s display. You\\'ve got the choice of either a 40mm or 44mm case for this watch, and it comes with a wide variety of fitness features.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for the absolute best from Apple, the Series 5 watch is sure to offer it with its ECG monitor, GPS tracking, impressive heart rate monitoring, and lots more.\\n\\nDon\\'t need that always-on display we\\'ve mentioned above? The Apple Watch 4 doesn\\'t come with that, and it\\'s far cheaper than the Apple Watch 5. So you may prefer to get this version instead and save a bit of money.\\n\\nIt also comes in both 40mm and 44mm variants, plus a lot of the features are similar such as the excellent heart rate tracking and the larger display than you\\'ll find on older Apple Watches.\\n\\nThe most exciting tech here is the fact that there\\'s an ECG feature within the heart rate tracker. It can test your heart to see if you\\'re at a high risk of atrial fibrillation, which will allow you to seek help earlier if your health is in danger. This is found on the Apple Watch 5 too, but not older models.\\n\\nThe Apple Watch 3 (or Apple Watch Series 3, if you\\'re picky) was once the very best smartwatch, but it has since been bumped down by the Apple Watch 4 and 5. That said, it\\'s still a great device, especially as it\\'s now cheaper than ever.\\n\\nIt comes with a smaller display than the Apple Watch 4, and you won\\'t get features like the ECG monitor on the devices above, but it\\'s still a strong wearable for those wanting fitness smarts.\\n\\nThere\\'s also an LTE version of the watch available, for if you\\'re in need of a watch that can receive messages or phone calls even when you\\'re away from your iPhone. If you need a cheaper smartwatch but you want to buy an Apple Watch, this is our top choice.\\n\\nRead the full Apple Watch 3 review\\n\\nYou\\'ll probably notice that the original Apple Watch, the Series 1 and Series 2 device are all missing from this list. That\\'s because it\\'s hard to buy those devices new anymore, so we\\'ve focused on the more easily available devices.\\n\\nYou can still source the original Apple Watch and a variety of older devices from some places, but we\\'d recommend opting for one of the devices above as they support software for longer and are generally more refined devices.\\n\\nLargely the pricing for the Apple Watch works by how old the product is. If you want the Apple Watch 3, you\\'ll be able to find that for a lot less money than the Apple Watch 5.\\n\\nBelow we\\'ve got a live widget that will show you the latest deals for all the versions of the Apple Watch if you want to see the exact price right now. Bear in mind you can also get the Apple Watch 5, 4 or 3 on a contract because of the LTE features, and you can\\'t do that for the other two devices.\\n\\nUnlike Google\\'s Wear OS devices, the Apple Watch only works with one type of phone. You\\'ll need to have at least an iPhone 5 running iOS 10 or later to be able to use an Apple Watch or Apple Watch 2.\\n\\nIf you want an Apple Watch 3, you\\'ll need to have at least an iPhone 5S running iOS 11 software for the non-LTE version or an iPhone 6 to be able to use the LTE variant.\\n\\nBut if you\\'re buying an Apple Watch 5, you\\'ll need an iPhone 6S or later, which is the cutoff for watchOS 6, which is what that smartwatch ships with.\\n\\nA big change for the Apple Watch 4 is the size, so now it comes in 40mm or 44mm options.\\n\\nAll of the other models of the Apple Watch come in either 38mm or 42mm versions. Some color options are limited to certain size watches, but our simple advice here is go for the larger version if you want a watch with a bigger screen and you don\\'t mind spending a touch more.\\n\\nIt\\'s difficult to get the difference in size across here, but if you\\'re uncertain on size it\\'s worth trying each on in the shop to be sure. Below we\\'ve got three examples showing off the four different sizes, as well as a comparison of the screen sizes.\\n\\nYou\\'ve then also got to choose the color of your watch as well as what material you want it to be made of. The Apple Watch 4 comes in gold, space grey or silver if you want it to be made of aluminum, and the same colors come in stainless steel too.\\n\\nWhite and grey are also color options if you choose the ceramic version of the Apple Watch 3, but these are much more expensive and are called the Apple Watch Series 3 Edition. These are now hard to come by as Apple doesn\\'t officially sell them.\\n\\nThere\\'s also the Apple Watch Nike+, which is the same device as the Apple Watch 3 but comes with exclusive watch faces, the Nike+ Run Club app pre-loaded and a choice of lots of Nike branded sports bands.\\n\\nThat\\'s not all though. If you like the idea of a handcrafted leather strap, you may like the look of the Apple Watch Hermès.

       "    'title': \"Samsung Rising charts company's ruthless quest to 'beat Apple' [Q&A]\",\n",
       "    'body': 'Apple vs. Samsung is the modern Apple vs. Microsoft -- a battle between seemingly unstoppable tech titans. In his new book, Samsung Rising, author Geoffrey Cain charts the surprising story of the South Korean electronics giant. He also reveals how a burning desire to beat Apple drove Samsung\\'s successful strategies.\\n\\nCain, a former reporter for Time and Fast Company, based his book on more than 400 interviews. Over the years, he spoke with top Samsung and Apple executives to gain an insider\\'s perspective on the battle between the two companies. In this exclusive interview with Cult of Mac, he serves up surprising insight into a tech rivalry for the ages.\\n\\nCult of Mac: Apple appears on the front cover of Samsung Rising. Why go with Apple over Samsung for the book cover? What makes Apple so significant a part of this story?\\n\\nGeoffrey Cain: Apple loomed over Samsung\\'s efforts to become an admired, respected company. Former Samsung executives in the smartphone units told me they had one mission: Beat Apple. The CEO of Samsung\\'s office in Texas, which headed many of the anti-Apple marketing efforts, kept a photo of Steve Jobs on his desk as a reminder of his mission. When he interviewed potential executives, he pointed to the photo, and asked if they could beat \"that man.\"\\n\\nSamsung executives told me they thought Steve Jobs was a bully and a false prophet. They took offense to Steve\\'s snipes at their products. [Samsung] believed, from their market research, that Android users saw themselves as smarter and more independent in their choices than Apple users.\\n\\nThey claimed to me that Android users saw Apple users as \"sheep\" who just followed what Steve Jobs said. Then, Samsung took advantage of Steve Jobs\\' death to launch its first big marketing onslaught against Apple. This was a quest to beat Apple.\\n\\nCult of Mac: Apple has been involved with plenty of big tech rivalries over the years. What makes Samsung\\'s story so significant and worth telling?\\n\\nCain: Imagine if Apple were so admired and powerful that Steve Jobs was convicted of white-collar crimes twice and got pardoned both times by different U.S. presidents, without serving a day in prison. And those two presidents said, \"Steve Jobs is our great economic leader, a symbol of our great nation, and so he must stay at Apple.\" Imagine if we called the U.S. the \"United States of Apple.\" Yeah, we love Apple products. Steve had his own cult there. Samsung is on another level.\\n\\nSamsung is the world\\'s largest tech conglomerate. But it\\'s nothing like the giants of Silicon Valley. And unlike Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Uber, Samsung\\'s story has never been told in full detail. Americans know Samsung as a smartphone maker. But back in its home country of South Korea, it makes just about everything.\\n\\nIt consists of more than 50 affiliates that run a theme park, run hospitals, builds apartment buildings, sells life insurance, opens credit cards, makes semiconductors and displays and many parts that made the iPhone possible, and even consults on a cemetery. In Korea, you can live your entire life on Samsung products, cradle to the grave. South Koreans call their country the \"Republic of Samsung.\"\\n\\nThe strange thing is that the \"Samsung Group\" is not an actual company. It\\'s a phrase used to describe a web of companies tied under a complex shareholding structure. What they have in common is that they\\'re ruled by one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in tech. Chairman Lee Kun-hee tried to pass the reins to his son, Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee, now the de facto leader, as the chairman has been confined to a hospital suite since 2014 after a heart attack.\\n\\nWhen I was writing the book, I felt like I was watching an episode of HBO\\'s Succession. When Samsung tried to pass the empire to heir Jay Lee, it ignited a dramatic saga of corruption scandals, shareholder warfare and criminal convictions -- including the impeachment in 2017 and imprisonment in 2018 of South Korea\\'s president for taking millions of dollars in bribes from Samsung executives. Samsung\\'s heir, Jay Lee, was convicted of bribery and spent one year of a five-year prison sentence. Then he was released when an appeals court upheld part of his bribery charge but dropped other parts of his conviction. He awaits his last verdict soon, and could return to prison. He\\'s still vice chairman. That would be impossible at a publicly traded U.S. corporation.\\n\\nCult of Mac: Do you have a favorite story from the book in terms of the competition between Apple and Samsung?\\n\\nCain: I spent years and years exploring the Samsung offices tasked with beating Apple. And I zeroed in on Chief Marketing Officer Todd Pendleton and his talented team, based near Dallas. Apple was disrupting the tech world by 2010. That spelled trouble for Samsung, a major television and handset maker that had been slow to respond to the iPhone onslaught.\\n\\nTodd was a former Nike marketing executive who\\'d led the teams that signed LeBron James and other stars. All his colleagues described him as brilliant, talented and creative. Samsung knew it had a problem. Because Samsung produced so much hardware, it knew the quality of its hardware was quite good, in some cases surpassing Apple\\'s.\\n\\nIt even supplied Steve Jobs the flash memories that made advances in the iPod possible. But Samsung had a brand problem. People loved their Apple products. After Apple sued Samsung for patent infringement, Todd\\'s mission was to build a tribe of Android users. Samsung wanted to be the tribe\\'s leader.\\n\\nIn a smart and controversial advertising stroke, his team released a series of commercials that trolled Apple lovers. The campaign was called \"The Next Big Thing Is Here.\" It showed Apple users waiting in nine-hour lines outside Apple stores for the release of the next big iThing. Then they noticed a Samsung user -- at the time, Samsung wasn\\'t well-known -- nearby on a street corner, tapping away at their new phones. He\\'d show them his Samsung, explain that it had hardware features that Apple left out, and deflate them since the hype seemed overrated.\\n\\nFor a while, the strategy worked. Internal presentations and emails from the Apple vs. Samsung trials show that Apple marketers panicked and went ballistic. One Apple consultant called the moment a low point in marketing and said it was like 1997, the year Apple almost went bankrupt. Apple already put out its own series of ads, called \"Genius Bar,\" that were so derided, Apple pulled them.\\n\\nSamsung didn\\'t beat Apple as a result of the campaign. But it did turn Apple vs. Samsung into a business battle similar to Coke vs. Pepsi.\\n\\nCult of Mac: How do Apple\\'s and Samsung\\'s approaches to innovation differ?\\n\\nCain: Under Steve Jobs, Apple was the perfectionist company. The designs and user interfaces were pretty much planned down to the pixel. Apple wanted full control over the ecosystem, from the software to the hardware to the retail. When you used an iPhone or iPod, you were enveloping yourself in an experience. It was far more than a phone.\\n\\nThe love of Apple products gave Steve Jobs enormous leverage over suppliers, carriers and the like. When you walked into an AT&T store, you\\'d ask for an Apple. That wasn\\'t the case for other companies like Nokia and Samsung, which were essentially manufacturing companies. They had weak brands and user experiences because they were so focused on incremental hardware innovations. They lost the big picture.\\n\\nSamsung and other Korean companies do innovate, but in a different way. They rely on a process called gaeseon, or incremental innovation. This is more familiar to Americans as the Japanese word kaizen, the similar process that led to successes at Japanese firms Toyota and Sony back in the day. Samsung didn\\'t put out first-moving products like the iPhone. It carefully studied other products, and then looked for ways to improve on them -- bigger screens, faster data speeds, curved edges.\\n\\nSince they were so focused on improving on other people\\'s products, this put Samsung employees at enormous risk of copying their competitors\\' products. Indeed, Samsung executives told me that, internally, they were obsessed with \"benchmarking.\" And the Cupertino courts did rule multiple times that Samsung copied numerous Apple patents, though the two sides settled in the end.\\n\\nI would say that yes, Samsung copied Apple at the beginning. But it also innovated on smartphones in more incremental ways that, eventually, drove Apple up the wall. And Apple, under Tim Cook, began following Samsung. Apple began releasing bigger screens and better hardware. It realized that with more smartphone options on the market, it had to move beyond its original iPhone design and release bigger upgrades with each new device. \"Customers want what we don\\'t have\" went an internal Apple presentation during the Apple vs. Samsung wars.\\n\\nCult of Mac: How do they differ as companies internally, whether that\\'s in structure or company culture?\\n\\nCain: Apple has a tighter, more personalized structure. That\\'s been changing under Tim Cook. But really, in the past, it was all about Steve and Jony Ive and a handful of other visionaries. I see Apple as essentially a design company. Design is at the core of Apple\\'s identity -- that\\'s what allowed them to command the high-end of the market so early on.\\n\\nSamsung is the opposite. It\\'s massive. It has more than 300,000 employees. It has so many offices, units, affiliates, suppliers. Because of the bureaucracy, it\\'s hard to move the ship.\\n\\nSo Samsung has embraced what Koreans call the chaebol or \"wealth clan\" model of doing business. Chairman Lee Kun-hee is more like the Chief Visionary Officer. He wasn\\'t a hands-on leader like Steve Jobs in terms of getting out the products.\\n\\nBack when Chairman Lee was healthy, he\\'d make grand proclamations to his executives. He told them to \"change everything except your wife and children,\" and then set ablaze millions of dollars\\' worth of faulty phones and fax machines in the 1990s. He instigated a campaign of rejuvenation among his employees.\\n\\nThe employees then set out to implement the chairman\\'s vision. They reformed their design processes, improved their manufacturing quality, and elevated Samsung to one of the big brands, through a series of high-profile product placement deals in Hollywood. Their first big victory was to defeat Sony and become a premier TV-maker. Apple lovers like to make fun of Samsung today. But, back then, the company was a disaster. There was a good chance that if you bought a product, it\\'d be faulty.\\n\\nCult of Mac: Who is winning right now in the Samsung vs. Apple war?\\n\\nCain: I think Apple has gotten a strong edge over Samsung recently. But I also think that each side has scored victories against each other during the battles of the past 10 years. Samsung showed the world that there doesn\\'t need to be the one big device. Customers can choose from many options, form factors, price points. It also made a strong case, a few years ago before the Supreme Court, that Apple was starting to claim dubious patents to sue competitors -- like a black rounded rectangle patent that a court threw out.\\n\\nFor a while in 2017, Samsung overtook Apple as the most profitable tech company in the world. Then Apple came back. It\\'s been a tight two-horse race, though we should remember that Apple makes far fewer products at higher profit margins.\\n\\nI think Samsung\\'s lost the edge in the past two years. While Apple made a smart move to expand its software and content efforts with Apple TV, Samsung appears to be doubling down on a hardware-driven strategy. This at a time when Chinese competitors are catching up. It\\'s putting out foldable phones. But foldable doesn\\'t represent a huge break -- it\\'s a hardware innovation that has a few years\\' lifespan at most, before everyone can do it for cheap.\\n\\nThe problem is that Samsung was never able to get control of its own software ecosystem. It tried, but many software projects, like Milk Music, were shut down following resistance from Google. Google feared that Samsung was taking away momentum from the Android operating system. And Samsung\\'s OS, Tizen, hasn\\'t caught on.\\n\\nAll this shows that Samsung is, at its core, a hardware company. It announced a plan last year to supply the newest semiconductors for the coming A.I. technologies. I think that will be lucrative. But it doesn\\'t place Samsung in the high-end consumer electronics segment that Apple dominates.\\n\\nCult of Mac: Samsung weathered some pretty big lows over the years, like the Galaxy Note 7 that caught fire and the disastrous Galaxy Fold. However, the company bounced back each time. Why didn\\'t episodes like that prove permanently damaging to Samsung?\\n\\nCain: A few reasons that speak to Samsung\\'s unique culture as a tech giant. Back when the Galaxy Note 7 phones began igniting, posing a danger to the public, Samsung recalled them and replaced them with another batch of faulty phones. Then it had to recall them a second time. It was such a disaster that Samsung killed the phone altogether.\\n\\nAt the time, Samsung\\'s brand was in free fall. People associated the name Samsung with products that exploded. It was the butt of talk show jokes and even a Grand Theft Auto mod that allowed you to throw Note 7s like grenades at cars and people in Los Santos, the fictional California city. And Samsung responded defensively and bureaucratically. Samsung\\'s PR department even launched a personal attack on me, emailing a news outlet and telling them that my commentary was \"inappropriate.\"\\n\\nYou\\'d think that this would be the end of the brand. But the genius of Samsung\\'s model is its size and scale. After the Note 7 was recalled, Samsung rocketed to record profits, pushing South Korea\\'s stock market to all-time highs. That\\'s because Samsung had made massive, long-term investments in semiconductors and displays decades earlier with the long-term in mind. Samsung was picking the fruits of a long, difficult harvest.\\n\\nThe Note 7 fiasco was terrible for Samsung at the time, but in the big picture, it made a dent. Consumers moved on quickly and forgot. The same holds true for the Galaxy Fold. Samsung simply makes so many products that it can absorb losses and move on from disasters.',\n",

       "    'body': 'In this week\\'s top stories: iPhone 9 rumors continue, iOS 14 features, Apple acquires Dark Sky, and a hands-on look at a powerful CarPlay accessory. Read on for all of this week\\'s biggest news.\\n\\nOne of the most surprising announcements this week was that Apple has acquired the hyperlocal weather app Dark Sky. Dark Sky announced the acquisition in a blog post and explained that the app for iPhone and iPad is still available and there will be no changes at this time. The Android app, however, will stop working in July and the Dark API will shut down in December of 2021.\\n\\nApple this week began beta testing of iOS 13.4.5. The update focuses primarily on bug fixes and performance improvements, but there are a few things worth noting. The update includes a new feature for the Music app that makes it easy to share a song to Instagram and Facebook Stories. The update also corroborates details of the upcoming iPhone 9 and CarKey.\\n\\nSpeaking of iPhone 9, 9to5Mac learned this week that Apple\\'s release of the device is imminent. The iPhone 9 will be available in black, white, and PRODUCT(RED) in configurations of 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB.\\n\\nElsewhere, iOS 14 code has revealed an updated Activity rings system for the Apple Watch\\'s expected kids mode feature. This would change the move ring so it now longer focused on calories, instead emphasizing how long a child is moving throughout the day.\\n\\niOS 14 code also suggests that Apple is working on new features for the iCloud Keychain password manager. These features would enable support for two-factor authentication codes as well as increased awareness of when someone reuses a password across multiple websites.\\n\\nFinally, iOS 14 code also indicates apparent support for Home screen widgets.

       "    'title': 'Nikkei, WSJ split on their Apple horror narratives - iPhone Discussions on AppleInsider Forums',\n",
       "    'body': 'Two major financial papers that usually blow out false news about Apple\\'s supply chain in lockstep have suddenly diverged in their imagined tales of how the world\\'s best capitalized and most proficient and competent tech company might be somewhat challenged by the economic disaster now killing thousands of people.\\n\\nNever mind the devastation, worry about a trillion-dollar corporation that has proven itself to be nearly impervious to disasters of all sorts. That\\'s the message from Japan\\'s Nikkei Asian Review and the Wall Street Journal, although right now each is pursuing the narrative in independent directions. Don\\'t worry about pandemic deaths and the conspicuous lack of action that is exacerbating what appears to be the world\\'s worst crisis since World War II. No, worry about how Apple is going to survive 2020 with its hundred billion dollars of capital waiting to snap up deals in the coming fire sales of despair among companies actually at risk.\\n\\nBoth Nikkei and the Wall Street Journal have a bizarre fascination with predicting some potential of doom for Apple that just never seems to materialize.\\n\\nIn part, that\\'s because Apple has incredible power and money. It\\'s perhaps the only global enterprise to simultaneously be the tariff-exempted darling of Trump\\'s United States and a \"too big to fail\" essential investment partner of the People\\'s Republic of China. If straddling the world\\'s two superpowers wasn\\'t enough, Apple is also carrying so much cash that its investors have been concerned that it is simply too rich to be able to effectively invest its money rapidly enough.\\n\\nOf all the trillion-dollar corporations-- or even Fortune 500 companies-- one could worry about, Apple is perhaps the most absurd to be shedding any tears over. Just over the past three months, Apple has danced around World War III and made a laughingstock of analysts like Toni Sacconaghi who have been claiming for years that Apple\\'s \"best days were behind it.\"\\n\\nThen, at the height of panic and isolation under the unfolding pandemic of the new Coronavirus, Apple floated out new updates that bring LiDAR 3D scanning and advanced AR to its new iPad Pro and rolled out much faster MacBook Airs, along with new Apple Arcade games and new TV+ series, as if its a Merry Christmas rather than a dreary crisis.\\n\\nNot merely tone-deaf to the situation, Apple has also used its platforms to offer reassuring, reliable information about COVID-19 from its App Stores, Apple News, and even its Apple TV+ collaborations with a motherly Oprah Winfrey to help us all cope with the uncertainty. The company also just made available a COVID-19 symptom screening website and app based on the recommendations of the CDC.\\n\\nYet despite all the upheaval caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, headlines still need to be made and stock prices still need to be manipulated by well-timed news drops from sources that are consistently wrong in their predictions about the absolute worst-case scenario that could possibly beset Apple. The reframing of the coronavirus pandemic as a reason to worry about Apple\\'s financial situation-- perhaps the best-positioned entity on earth in terms of clout and capital-- was kick-started by Japan\\'s Nikkei earlier this week in an absurd piece that speculated that the company\\'s upcoming iPhone 12 could potentially be delayed by \"months,\" based on nothing more than the same anonymously-sourced predictions the Nikkei has launched at iPhone virtually every year over the last seven, regularly claiming that Apple\\'s latest iPhone release was running into worrisome troubles that never subsequently materialized.\\n\\nThe story comes just several weeks after the Nikkei earlier claimed in February that \"public health experts\" in China had determined a \"high risk of coronavirus infection\" at Foxconn facilities where Apple assembles its products. That earlier report was immediately refuted by local authorities in Shenzhen. Officials stated in social media channels that the report was untrue. It also noted that inspections were still ongoing but that factories were expected to resume production \"in a timely matter,\" and that none of the factory operators have requested any \"need to resume production earlier (than the local governments\\' recommendations).\"\\n\\nThose factories have since reopened without any reports of \"coronavirus infection\" being a problem. The Nikkei didn\\'t retract its false report, it simply moved on to float out new ones.\\n\\nThe latest Nikkei bombshell aiming at Apple\\'s iPhone 12 launch date similarly contradicted known facts from reputable sources, including comments from Foxconn. Immediately after it was published, the idea was also refuted by Loup Ventures\\' analyst Gene Munster, who pointed out that Apple\\'s iPhone launches are not simply thrown together in the space of year, but involve three or four years of advanced planning.\\n\\n\"By the end of March in a given year, the vast majority of work on an iPhone design and planning with the supply chain is already done,\" Munster wrote. \"In the midst of 5G iPhone delay rumors, it\\'s important to keep in mind that Apple plans its business in terms of decades, not years - an under-appreciated long-term competitive advantage. At the core of this advantage is the company\\'s balance sheet, which allows it to survive the unexpected; everything from COVID-19, to a financial crisis, or weak initial demand for a new iPhone.\"\\n\\nComponent producers also pushed back on the Nikkei story, stating that Apple had not asked them to postpone production and that they had received no request nor any notification about production being delayed. If anything, component producers are bracing for limited demand in the aftermath of COVID-19 interruptions.\\n\\nThose interruptions have already hit Apple\\'s Android competitors harder than they have iPhone sales, as we predicted they would. That\\'s in part due to Apple\\'s resistant global operations, which can better adapt to crisis and prioritize development and production simply by way of Apple\\'s profitability and capitalization. For years, Nikkei has been outlandishly claiming, without any verifiable basis, that Apple had \"slashed production\" of its latest iPhone. That\\'s been routine since at least 2013, the year that Apple\\'s chief executive Tim Cook first took the time to state in an earnings call with analysts that, \"I don\\'t want to comment on any particular rumor, because I would spend my life doing that, but I would suggest it\\'s good to question the accuracy of any kind of rumor about build plans.\"\\n\\nEver since, a variety of analysts and investors have consistently ignored Cook\\'s advice to instead entertain every rumor Nikkei has floated out, despite year after year proving that the financial newspaper was again wrong, and that what Cook had stated was correct-- Apple\\'s supply chain movements are simply so complex that no outsider has been able to accurately chart out what was happening in advance-- even in broad strokes.\\n\\nYet the Nikkei hasn\\'t stopped generating its fake news built on supply chain rumors. In 2015 it claimed Apple had cut supplier orders for iPhone 6s models by an unbelievable \"30 percent,\" then returned the next year with the story that Apple planned to cut its iPhone 7 orders in 2016 due to \"sluggish sales,\" then flat-out insisted a year later that Apple was slashing production orders \"in half\" for iPhone X due to \"slower than expected holiday sales\" the U.S., China, and Europe. It\\'s as if they were trying to see how dramatically they can lie without breaking down in laughter.\\n\\nThe Nikkei wasn\\'t just throwing out gag figures and letting its audience piece together a false impression of what was happening. Instead, it actually reported in early 2018 that iPhone X \"has failed to catch on globally,\" and then, in a sort of desperate attempt to boldly state the most preposterous horseshit possible, announced that \"iPhone X features facial recognition and wireless charging, but unlike previous models, is widely regarded as lacking any groundbreaking new technology.\" From the time Apple debuted iPhone X at the Steve Jobs Theater in late 2017 right up to the point where even Bloomberg was forced to admit that the new device had absolutely crushed all notion of expectations on how well a $999 luxury-priced smartphone could possibly sell, nobody with any grasp of reality could ever claim with a straight face that iPhone X \"lacked groundbreaking technology.\"\\n\\nYet the Nikkei did anyway, erasing any question of whether the company has any interest in reporting accurately when there is the potential to scribble up absolute lies about what is happening in the consumer tech industry just to promote outrage, controversy, and social networking engagement. And, perhaps, foment market panic.\\n\\nIt would similarly be a lie to suggest that Google\\'s Pixel 4 or Samsung\\'s Galaxy S10 \"lacked groundbreaking technology,\" because every major phone maker really has no problem delivering solid advances every year, thanks to the constant progress of silicon, software, and advanced product development. Introducing \"groundbreaking technology\" in a smartphone over the space of a year is actually not all that hard; the real challenge is introducing advanced tech at an affordable price that can sustain a critical mass of sales required to generate operational profits and successfully fund future research and development.\\n\\nGoogle has been historically forced to massively subsidize its money-losing Pixel efforts with its advertising revenue. Samsung\\'s high-end phone advancements are effectively paid for from sales of its far more profitable advanced components and displays. Even firms like Andy Rubin\\'s Essential were able to create \"groundbreaking technology,\" they just weren\\'t able to effectively sell it and stay afloat.\\n\\nThe willingness of the Nikkei to report such a boldfaced, confident expression of counterfactual nonsense should have erased its credibility completely. This wasn\\'t a typo or even an incredible mistake on the order of the Wall Street Journal falsely reporting that China\\'s Xiaomi was was ten times as profitable as it actually was back in 2013. This was a flat out representation of false information, coaching along a fictional narrative that was ultimately proven without any doubt to be dead wrong.\\n\\nNikkei isn\\'t just wrong when it\\'s bashing Apple. Late last year, the paper claimed Apple had increased orders for iPhone 11 \"up to 10%, or 8 million units,\" while also hedging its bets with the comment that \"suppliers remain cautious and said they were concerned that the higher level of orders would not be sustained.\"\\n\\nThose numbers didn\\'t predict anything, and there is no verifiable basis for believing that suppliers were \"cautious\" about iPhone 11, which turned out to again be wildly successful, reversing the expectations that investors had developed about Apple\\'s future potential.\\n\\nYet for some reason, when the Nikkei popped this week to claim that iPhone 12 might miss its due date by \"months\" -- a nutty idea that would seemingly require Apple to launch its new iPhone in the spring and miss the holiday season entirely -- skittish investors again scrambled as if they couldn\\'t not be fooled by a paper that has been consistently wrong in its reporting of consumer demand and unit production of iPhones since at least 2013. Next to the Nikkei, only Bloomberg, the New York Times, Reuters, Yahoo, CNBC, the Wall Street Journal and perhaps a few other major financial news sources have similarly generated consistently false reports about the future prospects of Apple\\'s next iPhone.\\n\\nGenerally, Tripp Mickle of the Wall Street Journal has simply repeated the Nikkei angle on Apple, embellishing the narrative with even more absurd figures that are just as unreliable and nonsensical, like a literal game of Telephone.\\n\\nThis week, however, Mickle took the unique tack of postulating that Apple\\'s supply chain production isn\\'t going to be its biggest problem. Instead, he mused, economic fallout from the devastating pandemic will cause Apple\\'s installed base of around one billion customers to balk at buying a new iPhone this year. As proof, Mickle found an anecdote in a 42-year old sports-radio producer who has been laid off, making it difficult to justify his normal purchase of \"four new iPhones every two years\" for his family.\\n\\nOf course, Apple never sells every one of its iPhone users a new iPhone each year. The company\\'s current sales have hovered about a quarter billion new iPhones each year, meaning that on average only about a quarter of its customers buy a new iPhone in any given year. Mickle\\'s anecdotal, financially strapped individual has the next two years to catch up to his historical pace of iPhone buying, making it seem particularly strange that Mickle even cited the man as proof of anything. The media narrative of the last year has been that Apple was \"giving up on hardware sales\" to instead pivot to selling content and services, as if the company can only do one thing at once. That idiot hot take invented a year ago in response to Apple\\'s presentation of its new Services offerings including Arcade, TV+, and Apple Card has clearly continued to be dead wrong, as iPhone 11 outpaced the growth of premium Android sales and as consumers snapped up Macs, iPad, Apple Watch, and AirPods in record volumes.\\n\\nThe economic pressures on families and individuals who are unable to go to work this month-- and who may face a domino effect of other critical issues throughout this year as the pandemic continues to cause massive interruptions and tragic loss for people-- is a serious problem for every industry. So why portray things as particularly troublesome for a company that has so much cash that it can float through years of crisis without much problem at all?\\n\\nThat happened in 2008, when analysts and investors imagined that \"global macroeconomic issues\" would hit Apple\\'s luxury goods the hardest, perhaps blunting sales of the then-new iPhone, which was priced several times higher than a variety of competing smartphones from Microsoft, Motorola, Nokia, and many others. Those predictions similarly failed to materialize. Despite Apple\\'s stock price crashing in half twice that year, the company emerged stronger than ever and its sales of iPhones radically shifted the balance of power in the tech industry.\\n\\nDuring 2008, rather than retracting into a cave and helplessly watching as its cash reserves evaporated, Apple aggressively began investing in custom silicon under a new project that resulted in A4. Long before anyone appreciated how big iPhone could become, Apple was planning for a future where iPhone 4 would deliver the luxurious feel of a Hasselblad camera, and where casual mobile computing would shift from cheap netbooks running Linux or a scaled-down edition of Windows to a new ultra-slim tablet form factor branded as iPad.\\n\\nApple saw that future years in advance when many pundits still couldn\\'t quite grasp it years after watching it occur right in front of them. And as they moved on to worry about their next concerns about Apple, the company planned out future years of success that developed into global leadership in tablets, watches, and wireless earpods.\\n\\nApple\\'s cash allowed it to deftly line up partnerships and significant acquisitions like P.A. Semi at a time when analysts were screaming that the ceiling was collapsing and that investors should flee to the mountains and convert their wealth into gold. They were ultimately wrong; Apple\\'s stock climbed out the fearful 2008 to rocket upward as the company cranked out regular new advances, regardless of whether every person in America or the rest of the world could afford to pay for an annual upgrade to every Apple device they owned.\\n\\nThings have changed significantly since 2008. Apple\\'s stock is now valued around twenty times higher than its nadir that year-- even after the COVID-19 drop-- and the company has shifted from an upstart phone maker to being the only company selling premium-priced tech in massive volumes and at margins that are capable of shielding the company from even the worst of disasters. That included even the unanticipated combination of the earthquake, tsunami, nuclear plant failures, and other catastrophes that hammered Japan all at once, just as Apple was introducing iPad 2 with a variety of components sourced right at the epicenter of that composite disaster.\\n\\nA better question is: why is Mickle not even mentioning Apple\\'s peers: companies that are just as dependent on China if not more so, which will face even greater problems in producing their higher volumes of devices at much lower average selling prices, and for whom their audience of buyers is made up of people who are on the lower tiers of the economic ladder-- people who will be hit harder and be more adversely affected in their ability to buy flashy new phones or other products this year.\\n\\nWhat sort of market potential is greeting those fancy new 5G Android flagships from Samsung and Huawei, or those $1,500 to $2,600 folding display prototypes that the tech media has been both excited to review and super curious about why Apple wasn\\'t also floating out such gimmicky frivolity rather than building solid products that consistently sell by the tens of millions.\\n\\nSurely that\\'s a bigger story than whether some marginal fraction Apple\\'s minority of smartphone buyers will be able to afford to buy an iPhone 12. Apple\\'s customers range from well-heeled individuals who can buy anything Apple makes to the rank and file that somehow has survived the last five years of increasing economic disparity, and despite being hobbled by crippling student debt, healthcare costs, and low-paying wages with slim benefits, still somehow manages to stay up to date with Apple\\'s best iPhones and keeps flexing their AirPods and automatically pays for Apple Music and iCloud without stressing too much about it.\\n\\nAfter being so wrong for so long, finance bloggers really need to slash production of their own fabrications, because their stock is tanking.',\n",

The MacBook Air now features the latest 10th-generation Intel processors. The base model packs a 1.1GHz Dual-Core Core i3 processor, but you can configure it with up to a quad-core 1.2GHz i7 CPU.\\n\\nApple has also doubled the base model\\'s storage, going from 128GB to 256GB. In conjunction with that, the entry level price has dropped from $1199 to $999. Find out more details in our full coverage right here.\\n\\nNext up, Apple announced an all-new iPad Pro lineup. The new iPad Pro models feature a more powerful A12Z processor inside, while each model also packs 6GB of RAM. There\\'s also a new LiDAR camera array on the back of the iPad Pro, which measures the distance to surrounding objects up to 5 meters away.\\n\\nIn addition to the LiDAR scanner, the new camera array on the iPad Pro features a 12MP Wide camera, as well as a 10MP Ultra Wide camera. Read more about the new iPad Pro lineup here.\\n\\nFor the iPad Pro, Apple also announced a new Magic Keyboard with trackpad folio case. Apple describes the new Magic Keyboard as having a \"floating design with smooth angle adjustment.\" It attaches magnetically to the iPad Pro and features \"unique cantilevered hinges\" that allow it to adjust up to 130 degrees.\\n\\nThe Magic Keyboard with trackpad will be available in May. It will cost $299 for the 11-inch iPad Pro and $349 for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Apple also said that iOS 13.4 and iPadOS 13.4 will be available on March 24th. This update will bring full trackpad support to the iPad for the first time, which we covered in detail earlier this week.\\n\\nElsewhere, 9to5Mac exclusively reported this week that Apple is working on an \"iPhone 9 Plus\" to go alongside the oft-rumored iPhone 9. That would make sense considering that these iPhones should replace the iPhone 8 lineup, which features the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch versions.\\n\\nWe also reported that Apple is planning major upgrades to Apple Maps, including more details about Apple Stores, specific information about places with discounts for children, IMAX theaters, and more. For CarPlay, iOS 14 will bring the ability to set custom wallpapers for the first time.\\n\\nThese and the rest of this week\\'s top stories below.\\n\\niOS | tvOS | Mockups imagine what the leaked iOS 14 home screen changes will look like iOS 13.4 will be released on March 24, new Magic Keyboard with trackpad compatible with 2018 iPad Pro Apple releasing iOS 13.4 and watchOS 6.2 GM to developers iOS 14: CarPlay wallpapers, deeper Apple Store integration in Maps iPhone | iOS 14 code confirms Apple planning \\'iPhone 9 Plus\\' with A13 as larger version of rumored entry-level model iOS 14 code shows only iPhone 12 Pro will gain time-of-flight sensor for generating 3D models of environments Apple debuts colorful spring lineup of iPhone cases Apple Watch | How to set up hourly reminders on iPhone and Apple Watch to wash your hands and stop touching your face Apple debuts colorful spring lineup of Apple Watch bands iPad | Apple unveils new iPad Pro with backlit Magic Keyboard case, available to order today Watch Craig Federighi demo the new iPad Pro and Magic Keyboard with trackpad New Magic Keyboard with trackpad compatible with 2018 iPad Pro All 2020 iPad Pro models feature 6GB of RAM, same U1 chip as iPhone 11 Here\\'s how advanced cursor support will work on iPadOS Logitech announces new keyboard case with trackpad for iPad and iPad Air Mac | Apple announces new MacBook Air with scissor switch keyboard, $999 price point Opinion: The new MacBook Air and iPad Pro Magic Keyboard are game changers Apple updates Mac mini with double the storage Top Apple stories, retail | Apple responds to COVID-19 by closing all stores outside of China until March 27 Apple provides FAQ for returns and repairs during nearly global store closures It\\'s not just Apple Stores closed: 30+ other major chains closing their doors Apple website banner now says retail stores are closed \\'until further notice\\' Apps | App Store expediting COVID-19 apps from reputable sources, Apple blocking coronavirus-themed games and entertainment software How to get set up with Zoom and Skype on Mac, iPhone, and iPad Controversial Sonos S2 app adds hi-res audio but leaves old speakers behind Work From Home | Improve your work from home situation with a Thunderbolt 3 or USB-C display WSJ: Apple\\'s shift to remote working faces glitches due to secrecy, unclear guidelines Apple highlights the best work from home apps in new App Store editorial story How to work from home effectively during the coronavirus outbreak Comment: These are my must-have apps and services for remote working Working from home?

       "    'title': \"There's a Fight Raging Over Apple's App Store. Why Some Regulators and Developers Are Calling It a Monopoly.\",\n",
       "    'body': 'Text size\\n\\nBen Volach, co-founder of the email-app company Blix, was making the rounds of Apple\\'s annual developer conference in June when he happened upon a presentation of Apple Mail\\'s newest feature. The motto for the San Jose, Calif., conference was \"Write code. Blow minds.\" But Volach found that it was his own mind being blown.\\n\\n\"We were shocked to see Apple copying our technology and announcing it onstage,\" he says. \"A couple of days later, there was the shock that our Mac application was kicked out of the App Store.\"\\n\\nThe feature allowed users to access websites anonymously using email, similar to a function that Blix\\'s flagship BlueMail app had released 10 months earlier. Blix sued for patent infringement and claimed that Apple was using control of its App Store to bully competitors. In filings and statements, Apple (ticker: AAPL) scoffed at the idea that it\\'s a monopoly and said gate-keeping is carried out strictly in the interests of security and reliability. In February, after eight months, Apple returned BlueMail to its Mac App Store, saying the product now complied with Apple guidelines.\\n\\nApple told Barron\\'s that Blix declined its offers to help the company comply with App Store guidelines, and that Blix\\'s products posed security risks for customers. Once those issues were fixed, the app was allowed back in the store, Apple says.\\n\\n\" We were shocked to see Apple copying our technology and announcing it onstage. \"\\n\\n-- Ben Volach, founder of email-app firm Blix\\n\\nBut Blix -- which has 40 employees worldwide, spread across Israel, New Jersey, and the United Kingdom -- plans to fight on, seeking to lead a backlash against the App Store from a growing list of disgruntled App Store developers. Its patent-infringement claim against Apple is pending in federal court in Delaware.\\n\\nGovernment officials in Europe, the U.K., and the U.S. have also taken notice. While Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), and Alphabet unit (GOOGL) Google have dominated much of the regulatory attention, officials worldwide have made it clear that Apple is in their sights, as well.\\n\\nThe pressure hasn\\'t abated, even as the world deals with the coronavirus pandemic. On Monday, France fined Apple $1.2 billion, the largest ever penalty from France\\'s competition authority, which cited anticompetitive behavior in the distribution of iPads and other Apple products.\\n\\nBut Apple\\'s App Store is likely to come under increased regulatory scrutiny of its own, particularly as developers like Volach push back on the platform.\\n\\nDisgruntled customers and developers say Apple adds to its advantage by weighing the scales in favor of its own products, charging outsize fees, restricting how and when developers may distribute phone apps, and collecting and hoarding valuable business information about the developers\\' own customers. Apple takes a 30% cut for in-app purchases and first-time subscriptions.\\n\\nDevelopers in Europe and the U.S. are filing lawsuits, testifying before legislators, lobbying the European Commission, and urging regulators to look at Apple as a de facto monopolist whose moves warrant scrutiny.\\n\\nCritics describe Apple\\'s control over its App Store as more anticompetitive than Google\\'s rival offering, known as Google Play. A study by researchers affiliated with the University of Amsterdam concluded that Apple changes its rules when it releases its own products, whereas there appeared to be no such correlation with Google\\'s Android software. Android users can obtain apps from various marketplaces, including from Amazon and Samsung Electronics, while iPhone users are restricted to the Apple App Store. Google also makes it easier to set up outside products as the default apps on Android phones, according to Blix\\'s legal complaint.\\n\\nAll About Apps\\n\\nApple\\'s App Store is one of the company\\'s fastest-growing units.\\n\\n$15.3 B\\n\\nEstimated App Store revenue in fiscal 2019, according to Visible Alpha 20%\\n\\nEstimated growth for App Store revenue in fiscal 2019 -2%\\n\\nApple\\'s overall revenue growth in fiscal 2019\\n\\nIn statements to Barron\\'s and regulators, Apple refuted the idea that its policies and practices are intended to suppress competition. The company says its platforms are managed to promote developers\\' products, even in cases when Apple sells competing versions. Rules denounced by officials and merchants as anticompetitive actually protect consumers from fraud, eavesdropping, and other dangers, the company says.\\n\\n\"Giving developers a fair and level playing field has been key to our success -- and we will stay on that course,\" the company said in a statement to Barron\\'s.\\n\\nAs for the French fine, the company said the ruling went against precedent and harms French consumers. Apple says it\\'s planning to appeal.\\n\\nApple\\'s App Store generated roughly $15 billion in sales in the last fiscal year, up 20% from a year earlier, according to data from Visible Alpha, making it one of Apple\\'s fastest-growing units. iPhone sales were down 14% over the same period.\\n\\nGene Munster, a partner at Loup Ventures, a tech-focused venture-capital firm with offices in Minneapolis and New York, estimates that the App Store alone is worth somewhere from $150 billion to $200 billion. Apple\\'s total market value is roughly $1.1 trillion, accounting for the stock\\'s recent coronavirus selloff.\\n\\nThe App Store\\'s importance to Apple goes beyond revenue; the platform drives loyalty from users across Apple\\'s entire hardware and software ecosystem. \"If there\\'s much more scrutiny of the App Store, there would be clear business-model implications and some revenue headwinds, and it\\'s something that investors are keeping a close eye on as the Beltway takes a closer look at tech stalwarts,\" says Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives.\\n\\nMunster, however, believes that Apple might come out better than its peers. \"I think Apple is in the safest camp, even though this is a topic that will gain momentum, because I think the company will navigate this and succeed in maintaining its pricing structure,\" he says.\\n\\nBut Apple is a large target across the globe. Spotify Technology (SPOT), the Swedish streaming-music pioneer, has a complaint working its way through the European Commission claiming that Apple sets an unfairly high, 30% commission rate on subscriptions bought through the App Store. Last May, the U.S. Supreme Court, against Apple\\'s wishes, allowed a class-action suit alleging unfair App Store pricing. The case is scheduled to reach federal court in March 2022, but action could happen well before then.\\n\\n\"We\\'re confident we will prevail when the facts are presented, and that the App Store is not a monopoly by any metric,\" Apple said in a statement released following the Supreme Court decision.\\n\\nTile, a maker of Bluetooth location-tracking devices, says it has come up against Apple\\'s power in recent months. In January, the company learned that its products would no longer be sold in Apple\\'s physical stores. The timing coincided with reports that Apple was releasing a similar product of its own, in the form of an enhanced Find My iPhone app, says Tile\\'s general counsel Kirsten Daru. She adds that Tile began facing technical roadblocks with Apple starting last fall. \"All this came at the same time,\" Daru says. Apple also hired one of Tile\\'s key engineers shortly before the company released its new iOS 13 iPhone software in September, which, Daru says, gave Apple a \"material competitive advantage over us.\"\\n\\nDaru made similar comments to Congress in January. At the time, Apple told congressional members, \"Stronger privacy protections may not be in everyone\\'s business interest, but they are in the interest of every person with a smartphone.\"\\n\\nMore than a dozen parental-control apps, including Kidslox and Qustodio, fought a two-year battle to be reinstated to the App Store after they were booted when Apple introduced a rival app. They were allowed to return in September only after European Commission antimonopoly officials intervened on their behalf, says Viktor Yevpak, CEO and co-founder of Kidslox.\\n\\n\"Apple enjoys a dominant position, and it abuses its position,\" Yevpak said in an interview from his office in Ukraine.\\n\\nApple said in a statement that it had acted to protect consumers: \"We do not think it is okay for any apps to help data companies track or optimize advertising of kids.\"\\n\\nYevpak, like Volach, has stumbled into a role as resistance leader, as disgruntled app developers from all over the world contact him to discuss strategies to protest what they see as monopolistic behavior from Apple.\\n\\n\"Companies started coming up to me and saying, \\'Me too. Me too,\\' \" says Yevpak. \"Everybody in this field, the Nortons, the Kasperskys, the big players and the small players, are approaching me to complain.\"\\n\\nDavid Heinemeier Hansson, chief technology officer and co-founder of Basecamp, a project-management software offering, cites Apple\\'s App Store fees as evidence that Apple enjoys a duopoly alongside Google. He told a congressional antitrust panel in January that Apple\\'s onerous 30% commission is clear evidence that it has market power. Basecamp now avoids the fee by providing its apps free in Apple\\'s store, while attempting to sell services on the internet, even though the process makes its product less customer-friendly.\\n\\n\"Most mobsters would not be so brazen as to ask for such an exorbitant cut,\" Hansson says.\\n\\nApple told the same panel that its fee was commensurate with the App Store\\'s role as a \"channel for the distribution of developers\\' apps and the cost of many services -- including app review, app-development tools, and marketing services.\"\\n\\nThe rhetoric from app developers echoes U.S. anti-railroad rebellions in the late 19th century, when protests against that era\\'s dominant commercial platform led to the creation of anti-cartel political parties and a national progressive movement with a trust-busting theme. Today\\'s app-developing rebels haven\\'t produced their version of the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act. Not yet, at least.\\n\\n\"I would expect Europe to be much more aggressive in the near future in terms of enforcement related to Apple,\" says Gene Kimmelman, former chief counsel for the U.S. Department of Justice\\'s antitrust division.\\n\\n\"We keep hearing concerns about the power of platforms, about the way they control our access as businesses as well as us as individuals,\" European Union antitrust czar Margrethe Vestager said in a Brussels speech a year ago. \"By controlling the terms of access, they expand their power across the digital world.\"\\n\\nLast month, the EU released a \"European Strategy for Data,\" which calls out \"imbalances in market power\" and highlights Vestager\\'s past comments.\\n\\nAsked during a recent antitrust event in San Francisco whether the European Commission\\'s strategy might soon include a crackdown on Apple, Kris DeKeyser, the EC\\'s deputy director general for antitrust, said, \"The commission will be a bit more granular in upcoming events.\"\\n\\nNewsletter Sign-up\\n\\nSeparately, the European Commission has levied a 4.34 billion euro fine against Google for allegedly breaching EU antitrust rules on its Android apps platform. In that case, now on appeal, the commission said that Google and Apple\\'s app stores operate as two separate markets, setting up Apple to be characterized as having market \"dominance\" on its own platform. Such a designation could enable European regulators to respond more aggressively to claims that Apple has abused its position.\\n\\nThe U.K. has also been assertive on this issue, with a major report last March urging the U.K. to enforce a \"clear set of rules\" to fight monopolistic digital platforms.\\n\\nIn the U.S., the House Judiciary Committee\\'s antitrust panel has sent a document-request letter drawn specifically from developers\\' complaints.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission are both conducting reviews into the tech industry. Spokespeople for the FTC and DOJ declined to comment about Apple.\\n\\nElsewhere, state attorneys general are sharpening their pencils and studying up on internet technology following announcements that eight states will confront concerns that internet platforms use their dominance to squelch competition.\\n\\n\"If you\\'re leveraging it to prevent or foreclose others from competing in your app store, preferencing yourself, or you have sweetheart deals, that can trigger a harm to competition that you could challenge under the antitrust laws,\" says Kimmelman, the former Department of Justice antitrust official.\\n\\nEmail: editors@barrons.com',\n",

       "    'body': \"Last week, without fanfare, Amazon Prime Video apps on iOS made a subtle change to the experience of purchasing or renting TV Shows and videos:\\n\\nThat screen is not Apple's in-app purchase screen, which was, by fiat, the only way to buy digital content on iOS devices. That meant that Apple received somewhere between 15% and 30% of ebook, music, video, etc. sales and subscriptions, even if Apple had nothing to do with their creation; another word for this is rent, thanks to Apple's dominant position in portable devices, particularly the high end.\\n\\nApple was careful to say that this wasn't a special deal to Amazon, noting in a statement:\\n\\nApple has an established program for premium subscription video entertainment providers to offer a variety of customer benefits -- including integration with the Apple TV app, AirPlay 2 support, tvOS apps, universal search, Siri support and, where applicable, single or zero sign-on. On qualifying premium video entertainment apps such as Prime Video, Altice One and Canal+, customers have the option to buy or rent movies and TV shows using the payment method tied to their existing video subscription.\\n\\nThe Canal+ deal is likely tied to the premium channel's decision to offer Apple TV set top boxes in lieu of its own back in 2018; Altice One made a similar deal earlier this year. Both, though, were about existing TV distributors (premium channels in the case of Canal+, and a traditional MVPD -- multichannel video programming distributor -- in the case of Altice One); Amazon Prime Video is an over-the-top streaming service with its own exclusive content, making this a much bigger deal than Apple's statement might suggest.\\n\\nMoreover, it's not simply a big deal, it's a fascinating one as well: you can make an argument it is better for Amazon, better for Apple, better for both, or neither -- it just depends on your point of view.\\n\\nView 1: A Win for Amazon\\n\\nStart with the narrowest point of view: the fact that Amazon can now sell and rent TV shows and movies on iOS devices from iPhones to iPads to Apple TV is a big win for Amazon. The reasoning is straightforward: 30% is a lot to pay to Apple, and now Amazon doesn't need to.\\n\\nIt's not a complete win, though: Amazon still can't sell e-books in the Kindle app. In that case (as with Prime Video previously), Amazon leaves it up to customers to figure out that they have to browse to Amazon in Safari to make a purchase; Apple doesn't allow apps like Kindle or Spotify to even suggest that customers can subscribe or purchase on the web.\\n\\nView 2: A Quid Pro Quo\\n\\nOf course Apple didn't make this deal in a vacuum: the company's statement clearly implied that the Amazon Prime Video app -- which until a couple of years ago, didn't even exist on Apple TV -- integrated the full feature set of the Apple TV app (yes, it is confusing that the box, app, service, and subscription offering are all variants of the name Apple TV).\\n\\nThe idea of the Apple TV app (which again, is different than the traditional Apple TV interface, and is available not just on the Apple TV box but also iPhone, iPad, and Mac) is to be the overarching interface for all TV viewing. Different video providers might have their own apps, but the content within those apps is surfaced in the same interface.\\n\\nThis is in certain respects a win for customers -- instead of navigating multiple apps to find one show, they can simply go straight to the show they wish to watch -- and definitely a win for Apple. They own the interaction point with the customer and are effectively commoditizing supply.\\n\\nIndeed, this is where most of the analysis of this deal has settled: both Amazon and Apple are getting what they want, and customers are benefitting as well -- a win-win-win.\\n\\nView 3: A Win for Apple\\n\\nI think, though, this analysis is incomplete, because it does not incorporate the broader video strategies of Apple and Amazon. The inclination of most people looking at the space is to assume that everyone is trying to be Netflix: earn a monthly subscription revenue for a library of shows, some number of which are created in-house.\\n\\nThe truth, though, is that Amazon has been making good money in video by doing what it does best: being a distributor; Variety reported back in 2018 that Amazon accounted for 55 percent of all direct-to-consumer video subscriptions. Moreover, Roku's entire profit margin is predicated on the same business.\\n\\nI have long argued that this was the best way to understand Apple TV+: Apple has, since the days of iTunes, understood the power and profit that comes from being a digital storefront; moreover, this approach fit squarely within the company's Services narrative, which not only was about increasing Services revenue, but also increasing margin.\\n\\nIn other words, Apple TV+ was actually about Apple TV Channels: give customers a reason to use the Apple TV app, and then sell subscriptions to HBO, Showtime, Crunchyroll, etc. That is certainly the best way to understand Amazon Prime Video: there is not nearly enough content to seriously challenge Netflix, but there are shows worth watching, which makes the Amazon Fire TV boxes worth owning, and the Prime Video App worth using -- and that means more subscriptions on which Amazon can take an ongoing percentage.\\n\\nIn this view, then, Apple is the clear winner: Amazon just made the Apple TV interface better, which means that Apple can sell that many more Apple TV Channels subscriptions -- presumably at the expense of Amazon. I think Amazon was willing to make this tradeoff for a few reasons (that I first detailed yesterday):\\n\\nThe third reason, though, suggests what I think is the real quid pro quo.\\n\\nView 4: Quid Pro Quo 2\\n\\nThis isn't the first surprising development in the Amazon-Apple relationship in recent years. In December of 2018 the two companies made an announcement that I found far more shocking than this one; from Bloomberg:\\n\\nApple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. announced their second partnership this month: the iPhone maker's music-streaming service is coming to Amazon's Echo devices in December. The move gets Apple Music onto the most-popular voice-controlled speakers, giving it distribution beyond Apple's own devices. Subscribers will be able to control Apple Music with Amazon's Alexa digital assistant, the first time Apple has opened up its music service to full voice control outside its own Siri technology. The decision pushes Apple's music service into more living rooms at a time when its own internet-connected speaker, the HomePod, hasn't sold as well as the competition. Given the breadth of Alexa-enabled speakers on the market, the move could also boost Apple's own subscription numbers...\\n\\nApple definitely made a trade-off here, effectively sacrificing the HomePod's biggest selling point for greater distribution for Apple Music. The real winner, though, was Amazon, which views Alexa as a critical investment and, by virtue of adding Apple Music, gained a meaningful differentiator relative to Google Home.\\n\\nAt the time I suspected that Prime Video on Apple TV was the quid pro quo; that seems even more certain now, particularly when you realize that Amazon has, in some respects, helped Apple compete against its own business.\\n\\nIt is not enough, though, to only consider Apple and Amazon, particularly now, in the coronavirus crisis. There will certainly, both here and elsewhere, be plenty of missives about what will, and will not change because of the dramatic upheaval that is happening now; it is hard to say anything for certain, in part because of the uncertainty as to when the current crisis will pass.\\n\\nAt the same time, I think there is a general rule of thumb that will hold true: the coronavirus crisis will not so much foment drastic changes as it will accelerate trends that were already happening. Changes that might have taken 10 or 15 years, simply because of the stickiness of the status quo, may now happen in far less time.\\n\\nIt seems very plausible that cord-cutting will be a leading example. The number of households with MVPD subscriptions has been falling steadily, but the cable business has still been a profitable one for everyone involved, from distributors to networks. What happens, though, in a severe recession without live sports, the single best reason to subscribe to an MVPD in the first place?\\n\\nI have previously made my case for the long run: MVPDs become de facto sports and live news bundles, in which a far smaller rump of customers pay similar prices for a smaller number of channels, almost all of which are devoted to live events and charge significant carriage fees. Meanwhile, almost all of the other jobs TV does, including drama, escapism, and filler, would migrate to streaming services that provided a better experience by virtue of eliminating time as a constraint.\\n\\nIt is the long run that is particulary interesting in the context of Apple and Amazon's deal, because that inevitably bring Netflix into the picture. I wrote back in January 2016 about the company's ladder strategy:\\n\\nNetflix started by using content that was freely available (DVDs) to offer a benefit -- no due dates and a massive selection -- that was orthogonal to the established incumbent (Blockbuster). This built up Netflix's user base, brand recognition, and pocketbook\\n\\nNetflix then leveraged their user base and pocketbook to acquire streaming rights in the service of a model that was, again, orthogonal to incumbents (linear television networks). This expanded Netflix's user base, transformed their brand, and continued to increase their buying power\\n\\nWith an increasingly high-profile brand, large user base, and ever deeper pockets, Netflix moved into original programming that was orthogonal to traditional programming buyers: creators had full control and a guarantee that they could create entire seasons at a time\\n\\nEach of these intermediary steps was a necessary prerequisite to everything that followed, culminating in yesterday's announcement: Netflix can credibly offer a service worth paying for in any country on Earth, thanks to all of the IP it itself owns. This is how a company accomplishes what, at the beginning, may seem impossible: a series of steps from here to there that build on each other. Moreover, it is not only an impressive accomplishment, it is also a powerful moat; whoever wishes to compete has to follow the same time-consuming process.\\n\\nThis actually underreported Netflix's approach: the company has further shifted from buying its own shows to producing its own shows, which required far more cash up front (thus the massive negative cash flow in recent years), but with far more upside down the road.\\n\\nHere's the thing, though: I am not convinced that Netflix's long-run optimal position is producing all of its own content. More importantly, I'm not sure this is the optimal position for content producers.\\n\\nDisney is, as it often is, the exception that proves the rule. I explained last year in Disney and the Future of TV:\\n\\nThe best way to understand Disney+, which will cost only $7.99/month, starts with the name: this is a service that is not really about television, at least not directly, but rather about Disney itself. This famous chart created by Walt Disney himself remains as pertinent as ever:\\n\\nThis is the only appropriate context in which to think about Disney+. While obviously Disney+ will compete with Netflix for consumer attention, the goals of the two services are very different: for Netflix, streaming is its entire business, the sole driver of revenue and profit. Disney, meanwhile, obviously plans for Disney+ to be profitable -- the company projects that the service will achieve profitability in 2024, and that includes transfer payments to Disney's studios -- but the larger project is Disney itself.\\n\\nBy controlling distribution of its content and going direct-to-consumer, Disney can deepen its already strong connections with customers in a way that benefits all parts of the business: movies can beget original content on Disney+ which begets new attractions at theme parks which begets merchandising opportunities which begets new movies, all building on each other like a cinematic universe in real life. Indeed, it is a testament to just how lucrative the traditional TV model is that it took so long for Disney to shift to this approach: it is a far better fit for their business in the long run than simply spreading content around to the highest bidder.\\n\\nImplied in this analysis is the fact that, absent alternative monetization mechanisms like theme parks or merchandise, content is indeed best sold to the highest bidder. Content has extremely high fixed costs, and zero marginal costs; it follows, then, that the fiscally responsible content producers sell that content to as many outlets as possible, in order to maximize their leverage on those fixed costs. The only reason to do otherwise is if, like Disney, you have superior money-making mechanisms internally.\\n\\nIt follows, then, that endorsing Disney+ as a strategy is unique to Disney; nearly every other content company, without Disney's ability to monetize content across properties and over time, ought to be persuing maximum distribution for that content. And that means selling to Netflix: the streaming service has by far the largest customer base and, by implication, the greatest willingness to pay.\\n\\nAnd yet, more and more content producers are seeking to launch their own streaming servies, from HBO Max to NBC Peacock and multiple examples in between. The economics of all of these offerings are, at best, questionable:\\n\\nI am very skeptical that these costs will be sustainable for most streaming services; my prediction is that most fold within 5 years, and that Netflix is there to pick up the pieces.\\n\\nThis is the most compelling lens with which to view Apple and Amazon's recent partnerships. Both, given their desire to be a platform for over-the-top services, are on the same side when it comes to a potential Netflix-dominated future: neither want it to happen. Netflix dominating means that shows are sold directly to Netflix; channels are pointless. Apple and Amazon both, though, want channels to exist, if only so that they can sell subscriptions to them.\\n\\nThis, by extension, is a reason why Amazon might be willing to strengthen Apple's platform, even as it competes with Amazon's; it would also be a reason for a further quid pro quo -- Apple offering access to its shows on Amazon's devices. This remains to be seen (and, frankly, probably outside the scope of Apple's strategic capabilities, Apple Music on Android notwithstanding).\\n\\nUltimately, though, I favor Netflix in the long run. Apple and Amazon's strategy both entail replacing MVPDs with a streaming alternative that preserves the existing value chain; value chain transformation, though, inexorably alters the point of integration within the value chain. It seems safer to bet on the company that is predicated on a completely altered future than those hoping for mere substitutes.\",\n",

       "    'title': 'Apple Watch Series 5 review: Better than any Wear OS watch?',\n",
       "    'body': 'Since its first iteration, the Apple Watch has been hailed as a best-in-class device. So much so, in fact, that many people cite the timepiece as reason enough to make the switch from Android to iPhone. That includes yours truly. Several factors recently convinced me to make a temporary switch to iOS, and the Apple Watch Series 5 was the clincher.\\n\\nComing from the Android ecosystem as an avid fitness tracker/smartwatch user, just how much better is the Apple Watch? Was it worth making the change?\\n\\nThe smartwatch is an example of a device category where design really does matter. It\\'s something you\\'ll be displaying on your wrist for all to see: a fashion accessory and a statement about who you are. This is something Apple clearly understands and has put a lot of thought into. Apple\\'s watch has a minimal and classy design.\\n\\nEveryone knows what an Apple Watch looks like by now, and it has changed very little over the years. It\\'s a small, rounded square that sits on your wrist -- and that\\'s really all there is to say about it. The only notable features are the digital crown (dial) on one side and a button sitting flush just below it. Together with the highly responsive touchscreen, these controls allow you to navigate through the UI. The digital crown is a particularly fine piece of engineering that has a surprisingly varied number of uses. It offers haptic feedback to mimic an analog control. Haptics, in general, are beyond excellent on the Apple Watch Series 5.\\n\\nTo go with the sleek body, the watch has a vibrant screen that brims with color and wraps neatly around the edges thanks to the curved glass. It comes in two screen sizes: 40mm and 44mm. These offer 394 by 324 and 448 by 368 pixels, respectively. I actually went for the smaller model, as I wanted something that would feel light on my wrist. I often found that other smartwatches would dig into my hand during push-ups, or feel uncomfortable on a desk while typing. Fortunately, the 40mm Apple Watch is something I can easily wear all day. Moreover, the screen real estate is still more than ample for interacting with the watch.\\n\\nThere\\'s also a built-in speaker that allows you to hear notifications and feedback from Siri, listen to music, and take voice calls.\\n\\nThe Apple Watch has a sharp, vibrant screen that brims with color.\\n\\nYou can get the watch in aluminum, steel, or titanium, though most will likely choose the more affordable aluminum. Both options are plenty resilient, and you get water resistance up to 50 meters.\\n\\nThe Apple Watch Series 5 finally gets an always-on display, meaning you can show off your favorite watch face (and check it) without the awkward, exaggerated wrist gesture to wake the screen. The always-on display is a little dimmer when not active, but it still looks great. It uses some pretty clever technology to achieve the effect without draining the battery, too. This works by combining Low Temperature Polycrystalline Oxide (LTPO) with Indium Gallium Zinc Oxide (IGZO) technology, which allows Apple to control the precise voltage supplied to each pixel. The combo enables a variable refresh rate that can go as low as 1Hz, drastically reducing the power consumed when the watch isn\\'t in use. Lift it up, and the regular AMOLED screen will kick in, slightly increasing the brightness.\\n\\nThe only downside of the design is that it has become ubiquitous. The Apple Watch is no longer unique or special, though that doesn\\'t detract from its quality.\\n\\nIn terms of sheer design, the Galaxy Watch Active 2 is arguably the closest competition. It has the same minimal aesthetic, but in a round form factor. The size options are identical (40mm or 44mm), and Samsung offers similar material choices, too.\\n\\nRead also: Galaxy Watch Active 2 review: solid smartwatch, inaccurate fitness watch\\n\\nThe screen is likewise just as bright, and just as high-resolution. The big difference is that Samsung provides far more robust customization options.\\n\\nThis is one area where I really miss Android. While the watch faces on the Apple Watch are varied and attractive, you still can\\'t create or download custom ones. This limits the amount of self-expression possible.\\n\\nOf course, if your main concern is fashion and style, there are plenty of beautiful smartwatches available from actual watch companies. These trounce the Apple Watch in terms of design, no problem, but they don\\'t tend to offer the same level of functionality. And no watch has quite gained the instant recognizability as the Apple Watch, for better or for worse. The Apple Watch is iconic.\\n\\nPowering the Apple Watch Series 5 is the Apple S5 chip, which is extremely snappy and surprisingly capable. Devs have gotten 3D games running on this thing and they don\\'t look awful. The Watch has an impressive 32GB of on-board storage, all the usual sensors, built-in GPS (no phone necessary), and optional cellular data.\\n\\nIn terms of hardware, the Apple Watch\\'s biggest limitation continues to be the infamous battery life. The Watch is supposed to last around 18 hours, though it will generally go a day and a half with normal use. You\\'re going to need to charge it every night, which means it can\\'t come with you on long hiking trips (you\\'ll only get 4 hours of GPS tracking) and it isn\\'t ideal for sleep tracking, either. This isn\\'t a huge problem for me, as I simply charge the device each morning while I make breakfast for my daughter. That said, it does take a while to charge at 1.5 hours and this means it often misses out on some activity tracking when I\\'m chasing my daughter around the house.\\n\\nNeither the specs nor the design are what set the Apple Watch Series 5 apart. Like all of Apple\\'s best products, the magic of the Apple Watch lies in the perfect marriage of hardware and software.\\n\\nOf course, the Apple Watch Series 5 handles all your smartwatch basics. It shows notifications, it sends messages, and it lets you pay for stuff with Apple Pay. It even shows the time!\\n\\nBut it\\'s the thoughtful software features, intuitive-yet-powerful user interface, and snappy responsiveness that make this such a fantastic product.\\n\\nWatchOS 6.1 really feels like a shrunken-down version of iOS. For example, you swipe down to see your notifications, and you can double-press the digital crown to call up Apple Pay. A swipe up from the bottom opens the settings menu, which includes some neat features such as the torch, and a \"find my phone\" function. Swipe left or right along the bottom to switch between watch faces, and raise the watch at any time to begin talking to Siri. A click of the digital crown will bring up the cluster of apps, while the button will show either a list of your currently open apps, or your favorites for easy access. Switching between open apps is almost as fast as it is on a full-sized mobile device.\\n\\nThe Apple Watch comes with a lot of built-in apps and services. You can control media playback, communicate with other Watch owners with a walkie-talkie (great/terrible for couples), make calls, or get directions with haptic cues straight to your wrist. Talking from your wrist is not an exclusive Apple feature, but it\\'s only found in a handful of smartwatches, and it\\'s surprisingly useful. I used it a number of times in situations where my phone was inaccessible, or my hands were full. It\\'s perfect for making quick plans, or telling someone you\\'ll call them back.\\n\\nTo me though, the real stand-out feature is the ability to control my iPhone\\'s camera. (The other big reason I switched to iOS was for the iPhone 11 Pro Max\\'s camera.) For my fitness YouTube channel and Instagram account, I need to regularly record myself training and working out. In the past, this has been cumbersome and I can\\'t count how many times I achieved a personal best on one exercise or another only to find I was out of focus. The Apple Watch Series 5 sends a live feed from the camera right to my wrist, and I can even swap between lenses, or shift the focal point. It\\'s game-changing for me, and it never ceases to impress friends when we\\'re lining up for group photos (note that Wear OS devices can do this too).\\n\\nSetting reminders is one of my favorite uses for the Apple Watch. Being able to speak to Siri as easily as raising my wrist is game-changing, and it\\'s much harder to miss notifications on iOS than it is on Android (this was something else that drove me away from Samsung in particular). In short, this takes a load off my mind and helps me be just a little less scatterbrained. It\\'s this kind of additional productivity that I was really hoping I\\'d be able to get from the Apple Watch.\\n\\nAlso read: The best Siri commands for productivity, information, laughter, and more\\n\\nOf course, I\\'d be remiss if I didn\\'t point out that Google Assistant on Wear OS is a better assistant. But Siri is more than capable of most tasks you might conceivably want from a watch (and it\\'s miles better than Bixby).\\n\\nSetting reminders is one of my favorite uses for the Apple Watch.\\n\\nJust like the iPhone itself, the Apple Watch really comes alive when you start installing third-party apps (which can now be done directly from your wrist). Finding these apps can be hard work, seeing as there\\'s no dedicated Apple Watch store on iOS (something Google does better), and the one on the watch itself is fiddly to use with few features for easy discovery.\\n\\nOnce you do find them, though, the selection of Apple Watch apps is pretty amazing. A lot of the big brand apps have watchOS counterparts, which includes the likes of Headspace, Todoist, Spotify, MyFitnessPal, Audible, and more. The Todoist app lets me not only tick off my to-do items, but even add new ones by voice.\\n\\nComplications, or watch-face widgets add greatly to this functionality. You can pick several widgets for each watch face, providing a quick shortcut to the apps of your choice. This lets you see useful information at all times, such as upcoming todos. Again, this really helped me stay on task throughout the day, as I was constantly reminded of what I needed to do next. Complications can be customized to a small degree, though it\\'s crazy to me that WatchOS has better widgets than iOS itself.\\n\\nSmaller developers are knocking it out of the park here and have found plenty of ways to be useful on the Apple Watch. Nano, for example, is a surprisingly feature-rich Reddit app; a great distraction in a pinch. I also enjoy Peak for its brain-training games. To me, brain training and smartwatches are a natural pairing.\\n\\nThe last smartwatch I wore frequently was the Garmin Vivoactive 3. That device had a lot of apps too, available through the Connect IQ store, but the selection paled in comparison to what Apple offers. Further, a lot of the Garmin apps either didn\\'t work or only supported newer Garmin models. You\\'ll get more apps with the Garmin Vivoactive 4 or Venu, but it still falls short compared to the Apple Watch.\\n\\nWear OS fairs better than Garmin in terms of app support, but again, the Apple Watch has it beat.\\n\\nFor many people, the Apple Watch has become their go-to fitness tracker and there is a lot to like here.\\n\\nGeneral activity tracking on the Watch is denoted by three rings representing your calories burned, exercise, and time standing. The watch measures your heart rate roughly once every 10 minutes (though some apps will measure more frequently), and there\\'s an FDA-approved ECG that can alert you to potential heart conditions.\\n\\nOne of the most vaunted features of the current line of Apple Watches is fall detection. If you should fall while wearing the watch and then fail to move, your watch can call for help. There have already been stories of Apple Watches saving lives.\\n\\nYou can monitor your heart rate and activity more thoroughly during workouts, but automatic-workout detection leaves a little to be desired; you\\'ll probably be better off starting activities manually. The GPS is precise, and the Apple Watch Series 5 has everything you need for a run built-in -- meaning you can confidently leave your phone at home. While a wrist-worn heart rate monitor will never be as accurate as a chest-worn strap (especially during weight lifting), the Apple Watch Series 5 is still one of the better options and does pair with a strap if you prefer. With GPS on, you\\'ll only manage around 4-6 hours, so it\\'s cutting it fine for a marathon (but still not bad!). To eke out the most battery possible, you\\'ll want to turn off the display and other connectivity, though.\\n\\nThere are dozens of stories about the Apple Watch saving lives.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the Apple Watch doesn\\'t track sleep out of the box, which is presumably due to battery limitations.\\n\\nThird-party options fill the gap, however. I used one called Sleep++ for a bit. When I found that app wasn\\'t logging my nightly wake-ups properly though (of which there are many, thanks to my 15-month-old daughter), I swapped it for another called Autosleep. Autosleep is excellent, and in many ways rivals the detail generated by dedicated hardware, such as the Oura Ring 2. You get a huge amount of information, including a readiness score that is based on HRV (heart rate variability), and resting heart rate.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s the story of fitness tracking on Apple Watch. What\\'s there is robust, but basic. It\\'s the huge variety of fitness apps that make the Apple Watch such a strong contender. Apps like Gymatic offer to count your reps at the gym, Endomondo is one of the best running apps, and there are tons of great guided yoga apps, HIIT sessions, and calisthenics routines.\\n\\nI really enjoyed an app called Endel, which creates relaxing soundscapes based on the time of day and personal metrics. There is a level of creativity and polish here that I simply haven\\'t found on other devices. If you are interested in using biofeedback to improve your health and lifestyle, the Apple Watch Series 5 has you covered.\\n\\nSo, how does the Apple Watch stack up compared to what\\'s available on Android?\\n\\nThe Apple Watch Series 5 base model cost $399 with an aluminum chassis. The stainless steel case starts at $699, while the titanium model costs a hefty $799. The cellular model starts at $499 in aluminum. That makes it significantly more expensive than most of the competition. In my opinion, though, it definitely justifies that price.\\n\\nWhile it\\'s true that there are some solid smartwatches for the Android platform, and Wear OS certainly has a few things going for it, the Apple Watch is a step above. There\\'s a reason this device has garnered so much praise: it benefits from a beautiful design, an intelligent UI, and impressive app support. It\\'s not perfect (battery life and sleep tracking let it down), and it\\'s expensive, too. Whether it\\'s paying for groceries with my wrist or getting reminders that I can\\'t possibly miss, there are countless times throughout the day I was glad to have the Apple Watch.\\n\\nAnother great thing about the Apple Watch is that it\\'s getting better all the time. Unlike Wear OS, which rarely sees updates from Google, the Apple Watch gets new features regularly and benefits from superb ongoing support.\\n\\nThe Apple Watch Series 5 is the first smartwatch I\\'ve ever used that became an essential part of my workflow, and I\\'ve only scratched the surface of what it can do.',\n",

       "    'body': 'In all fairness to the sell-side, the COVID-19 situation remains fluid, so projecting revenues and earnings is difficult. But should estimates be where they are? I don\\'t think so.\\n\\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been a name that I have been on the long side and on the sidelines over the years. I have never once been short Apple whether it be directly (via naked shorts) or indirectly (via puts or short calls). That being said, when Apple warned on its FQ2 guidance, and the stock price increased I was seriously close to pulling the trigger on a short position. For many years now, Apple has delivered great returns to its shareholders. Investors who have believed in management have been greatly rewarded. But when a company warns that it will miss on its guidance, but the stock charges to a new high anyway, we have reached a point of near insanity. In hindsight, I wish I would have gone short Apple. Alas, it never happened, and now we should look to the future of the company. Here are some fundamental facts that investors need to keep in mind:\\n\\nChina began to go into lockdown towards the end January, and remained under lockdown for the entirety of February. Only now, in late March are the lockdowns easing. So, Apple\\'s China business should see an impact for the first half of the quarter.\\n\\nGeographically speaking, the back half of FQ2 could be extremely weak as well. This is because Apple\\'s supply chain and overall domestic demand as well as European demand will crater as we see more store closures and less appetite to purchase smartphones. The economy outside of China is continuing to deteriorate. That being said, China is beginning to come back online for Apple from the standpoint of supply and demand. Stores continue to re-open and we should anticipate a recovery in Chinese hardware-related revenue.\\n\\nMost importantly however, may be Apple\\'s 5G problem. As coronavirus hits the economy, telecommunications providers are delaying en-masse rollout of 5G services. Apple\\'s planned iPhone 9 product has already been delayed, and a coronavirus-related delay to the 5G iPhone has been rumored. This could temporarily put a serious dent in the Apple growth narrative surrounding a 5G smartphone super cycle.\\n\\nAnd finally, investors need to understand the coronavirus isn\\'t just negatively impacting Apple\\'s iPhone product. It affects all of their hardware products, including lucrative products like Apple Watch and AirPods that have recently been growth drivers. Demand for, let\\'s face it, luxury hardware technology products will likely be negatively affected as a whole which will weaken Apple\\'s financial footing. The only bright spot here might be the Mac and iPad lineups as the work from home dynamic plays out positively for both products lines. But overall, this is a dynamic that will play out negatively for the majority of Apple\\'s hardware products.\\n\\nI published an analysis on where I could see Apple being valued in a base case, bear case, and bull case. This analysis can be found here. My base case valuation and price target was around $268 at the time. Keep in mind this was quite a few months ago, and these numbers need updates. We already got FQ1\\'20 numbers and some early indications at FQ2\\'20 numbers. Assuming Apple delivered 186.2 million smartphones this last year (which is my personal estimate), full year iPhone ASPs come in at ~$764.66/device. As of writing, the first quarter has just come to its conclusion and we have not seen any kind of iPhone SE 2 which was projected to launch sometime in March. This delay could be a drag on unit sales in the short term, but I believe we will have a stacked product launch. What do I mean by this?\\n\\nFirst of all Apple supplier TSMC (NASDAQ:TSM) has now said that they are still on track to assemble Apple\\'s 5nm A14 processor. Whether Apple pushes out selling these new devices until 2021 or not is up to them, but TSMC is seeing no disruption on their end. If coronavirus rolls over sometime in May or June, then a traditional September iPhone launch may not be out of the cards. It really depends on how fast the consumer returns. China is already coming back online in terms of supply, and consumer demand will likely follow. It really depends on how well demand outside of China performs. Coronavirus is going to weaken the US consumer, it already has. A weaker US consumer is weaker for Apple. Considering the gravity of this launch in terms of unit sales propulsion, Apple wants to time this launch just right. While I am no epidemiologist, virologist, or data scientist, here are my thoughts on coronavirus:\\n\\nApril will be the worst month in terms of growth of the virus. This is when we start to see testing become more readily available across the nation, and we see if social distancing related actions in March are having a positive effect on the \"curve\". By May, I can see some of these lockdowns being lifted and the country going back to work in a limited fashion. June should be the beginning stages of an economic recovery as new cases will have likely peaked. There already is a stimulus package working its way throughout the economy aimed (in part) at the small business and the average worker. This stimulus package should help lower-wage workers receive enough to make ends meet until they can return to employment. That being said, there are a lot of businesses (smaller ones in particular) that are closing for good. Some of these workers filing for unemployment might not return to their normal jobs when this whole turmoil stabilizes. So, the consumer may not come back as strong as bullish investors anticipate. We have not gotten any official confirmation of when Apple plans on launching the next generation of iPhone, but unless the situation materially digresses from this point onward, I do not see a reason for Apple to push out the launch.\\n\\nAssuming the launch is still on schedule for September of this year, here is what I believe we could expect: in short a super cycle driven by explosive 5G related marketing. I anticipate the launch of five devices. If Apple would have launched the smaller iPhone SE-esque model on time, then it would only be four devices. I believe the depth and breadth of the product portfolio this cycle will be enough to spur consumer demand. Combined with marketing driven hype surrounding Apple\\'s new 5G models and I can see potential for supercharged demand.\\n\\niPhone Numbers\\n\\nWith all of this being said, what are my estimates for iPhone sales in fiscal 2020. Personally, using the data that we have on Apple\\'s iPhone numbers in the most recent fiscal year I estimate Apple sold 186.2 million iPhone devices at an ASP attach of ~$765/device. Apple already gave us their FQ1 iPhone revenue numbers, and Gartner estimates that iPhone unit sales reached 69.55 million units in the holiday quarter. This means Apple saw iPhone ASPs of ~$804.55.\\n\\nThe reason I am using two year growth rates here is because this is when Apple last gave us official iPhone unit sales. So this is the only real comparable I have without getting too much into the weeds on third-party data. My FQ2\\'20 number is based off of this estimate. FQ3 estimates are based on the belief that we see the trend that played out in Asia in FQ2 play out in FQ3. FQ4 is when we see some of that pent-up demand come into effect as well as the launch of Apple\\'s next generation of smartphones.\\n\\nFor the full year, I am projecting ASPs of $805, growth on a Y/Y basis. Combine units with ASPs, and my full year revenue estimate is $142.533 billion from iPhone alone.\\n\\niPad/Mac/Wearables & Other Numbers\\n\\nOn the iPad and Mac front, I believe Apple could see some tailwinds from the iPad and the Mac. Apple Watch might also see some benefit as the world becomes more health-conscious. Previously, I anticipated that the iPad and Mac lineup would see modest revenue declines this year, following the trend that has been taking place over the last few years. Now however, I anticipate revenue numbers expand in fiscal 2020. This is driven by the stay-at-home environment. Apple\\'s MacBook lineup may see a benefit from work-from-home spurring sales of laptops. That being said, MacBooks and Apple products in general are much pricier than standard laptops. And considering Windows is generally the default operating system for enterprises, Mac may not feel the growth tailwind as much. This is similar on the iPad front. Nonetheless, a rising tide (work from home economy) lifts all boats, Apple\\'s included. As such, I am modeling modest growth in both iPad and Mac revenues compared to my prior expectations of a modest decline.\\n\\nNow that we have my expectations for Mac and iPad numbers, let\\'s move on to my expectations for Apple\\'s wearables unit. This is the unit that includes Apple\\'s AirPods and Apple Watch. I believe the Apple Watch could be positively affected by coronavirus as individuals become increasingly invested in tracking their health. AirPods on the other hand, seem to be a quite niche luxury headphone product that has no material application in the midst of this global health crisis. In the most recent quarter, Apple grew this business at a clip of 37%. Considering AirPods comps will get tougher as the year progresses and that Apple Watch may see a boost over the course of the coming year, I see wearables growing at a fairly robust 28% Y/Y to $31.337 billion in revenues.\\n\\nServices\\n\\nWith regards to Apple\\'s services business segment, I anticipate a mild deceleration in top-line growth. Coronavirus will likely have an impact on two segments of services in particular: Apple Music and AppleCare+. AppleCare+ revenues are directly correlated with new device purchases. Less device purchases, less AppleCare+ plans subscribed too. Apple Music could see a wave of cancellations among individuals cutting back personal expenses, as Apple Music is hardly a necessity in these trying times. In FQ1, Apple grew services revenues at 12%, a sharp deceleration from the prior quarter\\'s 18% growth. I expect Apple to see ~15% services growth this year, to $53.234 billion.\\n\\nFINAL VALUATION\\n\\nI believe Apple will see a total gross profit of $104.951 billion, 67.03% of which comes from hardware. I\\'m modeling out to $35.028 billion in operating expenses this year, in-line with my previous view. Backing out these operating expenses, I get to operating income of $69.923 billion. Of this operating income hardware should represent 67% while software should represent ~33%. So, Apple should see operating income of $46.869 billion from hardware, while software operating income should total $23.054 billion. Back out a tax rate of 16.5%, and net income should be split like this: $39.135 billion from hardware, $19.25 billion from software.\\n\\nWhere this valuation gets interesting is when we apply multiples to these earnings estimates.\\n\\nI believe Apple\\'s 5G iPhone cycle will be a supercycle that drives revenue growth going into next year and years to come. While I was previously less optimistic on the multiple (hardware technology traditionally trades at 10-15X), I am getting more constructive on the valuation as I can see a path to rapid growth. Because Apple has such a strong brand, is entering a potentially massive 5G iPhone supercycle, I believe that the stock can get a multiple closer to 18X. This brings me to a hardware valuation of $704.43 billion, ~$160.97/share.\\n\\nFor software, normally software companies growing at Apple\\'s rate should trade at 20-25X earnings. I am going to apply a multiple at the midpoint of this range, 22X earnings. On 22X earnings, Apple\\'s services business is worth $423.5 billion, ~$96.77/share.\\n\\nMy base case valuation is $257.74/share. Thus my price target is $258.\\n\\nCoronavirus has thrown a monkey\\'s wrench into the Apple bull case. As a result, I am tweaking some of my assumptions in my model and I arrive at a $258 price target. Not considering the ~1.3% dividend yield, you are looking at fundamental upside of ~5%. This simply is not enough upside for me to justify a buy rating at this time. That being said, if the name begins to move lower, it could begin to appear attractive.\\n\\nTIPRANKS: HOLD\\n\\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

       "    'title': 'Apple Arcade is already straying from its original promise',\n",
       "    'body': 'Today marks the six-month anniversary of Apple Arcade, and Apple\\'s subscription-based gaming service has every reason to be booming. It\\'s got over 100 games, it costs only $4.99 a month, and Apple is offering this package at a time when much of the world is sequestered indoors and saving money out of fears of a financial crisis.\\n\\nAnd yet Apple barely mentions the service in public anymore. New releases of Apple Arcade games rarely make ripples on social media. It\\'s still too early to say \"Game Over\" for Apple Arcade, but this is as good of a time as any to wonder what went wrong and figure out how Apple could improve the situation.\\n\\nThere is some hope for Apple Arcade, partly because there has been a noticeable change in its direction. The situation was a little direr just a month ago, as ahead of the half-year mark you could already find some outlets proclaiming doom and gloom in the wake of Apple Arcade\\'s contemporary releases and the service\\'s seemingly slow adoption rate. But late last month, Apple managed to kickstart a tad more interest in the service with the release of Crossy Road Castle, which essentially gave Apple Arcade its own version of Super Mario Bros. Two weeks later, it followed up with Roundguard, a fantasy dungeon crawler that draws liberally from Peggle. Notably, both of these games \"feel\" more like traditional mobile games than the bulk of what came before them in Apple Arcade, which may signal a shift in strategy from the folks in Cupertino. I can\\'t say I\\'m exactly happy with it, but at this point I\\'m ready to admit it might be the smart way to go.\\n\\nDropping the dream\\n\\nApple Arcade was so attractive in those early months precisely because it distanced itself from the negative associations of mobile games. Not only do Apple Arcade games not have in-app purchases, but early games like Sayonara Wild Hearts and What the Golf? bore little resemblance to what you normally found under the Games heading in the App Store. These felt like games that usually would have launched on platforms like the Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4, and indeed Sayonara dropped on both those systems on the same day it appeared on iOS.\\n\\nWith such a move, Apple legitimized mobile games for the usual \"gamer\" crowd. While ports of console games to iOS aren\\'t terribly uncommon, you almost never see them drop on iOS at the same time they drop elsewhere. And in this case, you were even saving money. Sayonara Wild Hearts costs $12.99 on the Xbox, PS4, and Switch stores, but in the Apple ecosystem, all you have to pay is your $4.99 monthly Apple Arcade subscription. That\\'s roughly twice the price of taking a bus ride here in San Francisco.\\n\\nThe dream faded quickly. Six months later, it seems safe to argue that releasing 53 games at once on launch day wasn\\'t the best strategy. Instead, Apple should have gone for a more piecemeal approach, such as starting with around 30 games and building the library from there. As it is, we got front-loaded with all kinds of wonderful games, but we only got a handful of new releases that lived up to that level of quality in the following months.\\n\\nThat\\'s not to say there weren\\'t some gems, and a few of those follow-up games even make my list of the 10 best Apple Arcade games. Consider Manifold Garden, which looks like it takes place inside an M.C. Escher print. Or (please) check out Pilgrims, which presents a charming new take on the collectible card genre. These games are very much in that \"art house\" tradition of gaming I advocated for Apple Arcade last year, and they\\'re well-suited to Apple\\'s original promise of \"critically acclaimed\" games that stand out for their \"originality, quality, creativity, and fun.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s been harder for Apple to live up to all elements of such a promise as of late. Recent games like Doomsday Vault and No Way Home were definitely good, but not so good to recommend that someone should pick up Apple Arcade for the sake of playing them alone. We were slipping away from Apple\\'s claims of letting us play \"something extraordinary\" by \"some of the most critically acclaimed game developers in the world.\"\\n\\nThe low point came just earlier this month with the release of Loud House: Outta Control, which is about as stereotypical of a mobile game as one could imagine -- without the cash shop elements. As with a lot of recent Apple Arcade games, I have a strong suspicion that these elements were originally planned for Outta Control. You can feel them when you play like a ghost looming behind your shoulder, whispering that it\\'s okay to plunk out $5 to unlock something.\\n\\nConcealed cash shops\\n\\nIt\\'s an increasingly common feeling in Apple Arcade. You can also feel a bit of it in Crossy Road Castle and Roundhouse, but at least they feel like they hail from that happy period in the mid-2000s when iOS games evoked more joy than frustration. As much as I hate to admit it, this may be a wise new direction for Apple Arcade. Regardless of what Apple wants people to think, users have appeared to have settled on thinking of Apple Arcade as a mobile gaming service for traditional iOS games but without the expected in-app purchases. And so, Apple seems to think, why not just lean into it? Viewed with that lens, even Loud House: Outta Control may have marked the start of this shift.\\n\\nApple may be making this shift for reasons that are beyond its direct control. The company always emphasizes that it wants only quality, \"creative\" games in Apple Arcade, but the fact is that games fitting that description don\\'t even come out that often on consoles, much less smartphones. We\\'re blessed to live in an age where new games drop for platforms like the Nintendo Switch or Xbox One all the time, but out of all those dozens (or hundreds!) of games, only a few manage to win widespread attention outside the small but vocal group of gamers who try to play everything that comes out. Most of us have neither the time nor the money to do that, and so -- outside of buying games from our favorite series or genres -- we tend to focus on the best of the best. Such games are rare and precious, as I believe Apple is just now discovering. There\\'s a reason why Limbo and The Room still do so well on the App Store despite being so old: There\\'s nothing else quite like them. We can\\'t expect to see games like that every Friday.\\n\\nBut we can, at least, expect to see them on other systems. Apple insists on \"mobile exclusivity\" for Apple Arcade, which basically means that developers are free to release an Apple Arcade game on the PC, Nintendo Switch, or Xbox One, but it can only be on the iPhone or iPad for mobile device. (In practice, this largely just means they can\\'t be on Android.) But games like Limbo and The Room, while still known as iOS staples, have seemingly done so well for their developers precisely because they\\'re on both systems.\\n\\nThere\\'s a good chance that Apple\\'s arrangement scares away developers who might otherwise want their games on Apple Arcade (and it would definitely be in Apple\\'s best interests to have the next Limbo on Apple Arcade). Apple could probably work around this by making its Apple Arcade subscription model work more like Microsoft\\'s Game Pass for the Xbox. For that service, players get access to over 100 games for just $9.99 a month. That includes some newer cross-platform games like Wolfenstein: Youngblood in addition to older titles like the first two Borderlands games. If someone wanted to play Youngblood on the PS4, they\\'ll still have to plunk out the full $30.\\n\\nFunny enough, Apple also insists on exclusivity in subscription services, which means you won\\'t find Apple Arcade games in services like, well, Game Pass. As we\\'ve seen with Youngblood, though, Microsoft is willing to keep that exclusivity limited to a few titles. Apple should consider doing the same.\\n\\nA growing library, but what about subscribers?\\n\\nAll of this is skirting around the real reason why \"critically acclaimed\" developers may not be as keen to try Apple Arcade anymore: It\\'s not clear if they\\'d be making enough money from it. Apple may have announced a record-breaking $12.7 billion in services revenue during its first-quarter earnings call last January, but Apple CEO Tim Cook was vague on what those numbers mean for Apple Arcade.\\n\\n\"Apple Arcade, our new game subscription service, has been fast off the blocks with a catalog of over 100 new and exclusive games you won\\'t find anywhere else,\" Cook said at the time. And, yep. That\\'s true. But after six months, it\\'s easy to get the impression that Apple Arcade\\'s subscriber base isn\\'t growing as quickly as its library, and without knowing the numbers, I could see how developers might feel more comfortable letting their games fend for themselves in the open App Store.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth wondering if the economic climate over the last few weeks will make Apple Arcade more appealing to studios, as people likely aren\\'t spending money as freely as they were just a couple of months ago. Speaking as an increasingly cash-conscious consumer, Apple Arcade currently sounds like a really good deal for interactive entertainment.\\n\\nBut the Apple Arcade we have now is not the one I wanted -- and the one we had for a few brief weeks after launch. On the iPhone, it\\'s basically just becoming a variation on business as usual. Maybe that\\'s what it will take for Apple Arcade to thrive under such conditions, but it\\'s also not the kind of vision I expect from Apple.\\n\\nNote: When you purchase something after clicking links in our articles, we may earn a small commission.

O\\'Shea Jackson Jr. (Ice Cube in Straight Outta Compton) will take over the lead role.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: Swagger does not yet have a projected release date, but the on-set injury of the lead actor, and his replacement, probably means a lot of re-shoots.\\n\\nThe Sky is Everywhere\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: According to a report from The Hollywood Reporter, Apple has teamed up with indie production company A24 to produce a film adaptation of the young adult novel The Sky is Everywhere.\\n\\nThe novel tells the story of a high school girl whose older sister suddenly dies.

Abrams\\' production company Bad Robot, though besides getting an executive producer credit, it doesn\\'t appear Abrams will be directly involved.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: Lisey\\'s Story has no release date yet.

Deadline reports that Apple is buying up the rights to make a TV show of the cult classic film.\\n\\nThe film, about a young boy who gets caught up with a troupe of thieves as they hop across history to steal treasure, ever on the run from the \"supreme being\" from whom they\\'ve stolen their time map, is good fodder for a TV show. But the film has a dedicated cult following who will place high demands on maintaining the film\\'s heart and quirky sense of British humor.\\n\\nImportant names: Terry Gilliam will have an executive producer role, but will not write for the show. A report in Variety says that the series will be directed by Taika Waititi, whose quirky film What We Do in the Shadows earned him a cult following, and who earned huge international acclaim for his direction of Thor: Rangrarok and Jojo Rabbit.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: Time Bandits (if that\\'s even the show\\'s name) does not yet have a release date.\\n\\nCalls\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: On the French premium cable channel Canal+ you\\'ll find a new series named Calls.

       "    'title': \"Why iPad Pro's LiDAR is a big step for Apple in computer vision and AR - iPad Discussions on AppleInsider Forums\",\n",
       "    'body': 'The new LiDAR camera sensor that debuted in Apple\\'s latest iPad Pro this week is an enhancement upon the depth sensing TrueDepth front-facing imaging array that first made its appearance on iPhone X in late 2017. This year as it arrives on iPhone 12, LiDAR appears to set to achieve a massive installed base of tens of millions of users. Here\\'s why that\\'s important.\\n\\nApple is often chided for not being the first company to roll out new technology. Three years ago, I addressed this in the editorial When Apple is 2 years behind you, put your things in order, which noted that \"there is a solid decade of evidence that, for Apple, being behind is a competitive advantage.\"\\n\\nOver the past year, for example, various Android enthusiasts have tried to make a big deal about the folding OLED displays debuted by Samsung, Motorola, and Huawei-- despite their staggering cost and very limited real benefit, greatly outweighed by significant downsides including vastly increased fragility and the loss of water resistance. It\\'s no mystery why folding phones are still priced in the stratosphere. All of these companies were already just barely selling their flagship premium phones priced above $500, let alone these folding concepts priced north of $2,000.\\n\\nThe price of folding displays will have to radically drop before any significant number of consumers adopts them, and prices don\\'t come down just because new generations are being offered. They have to actually be bought up in quantity to bring prices down, because profits enable more efficient and better iterations of new products to achieve lower prices.\\n\\nThat\\'s simply how component pricing works. There is also no large, inherent demand for folding devices; we all moved from flip phones to the iPhone form factor because of the huge jump in functionality possible with a large touch screen.\\n\\nWe aren\\'t moving back out of some bizarre nostalgia for a \"click\" sound paired with 2003-era functionality, no matter how many writers line up to carry water for Motorola and Samsung\\'s marketing groups telling us up is down, and that basic flip phones are so much fun to click open and shut that they\\'re worth $1,500 more than just carrying around a pair of coconut shells with your iPhone. Even technologies that promise offer significant advantages -- such as emerging 5G mobile networks -- have benefits that are tied to dependencies ranging from the actual availability of 5G networks to the extra cost required to access that faster network capacity. The only thing that will bring 5G modem pricing down is the emergence of high volume demand for 5G phones.\\n\\nAs we saw from the rollout of 4G, that can only occur if the market invests in advance to deliver volume sales. Get too far ahead of that demand, and you end up having bet on a large inventory of early generation tech that you\\'re losing too much money on to continue building the future. That was a major problem for Motorola and HTC.\\n\\nBack in 2012, Apple could belatedly adopt 4G after allowing its Android competitors to race in and dabble with first-generation 4G components. Only after 4G networks were becoming broadly available did Apple place its own high-volume orders that brought down its component pricing dramatically. That allowed Apple\\'s first 4G LTE iPhone 5 to compete favorably with Android makers who already had years of 4G phones under their belts. iPhone 5 was not the first 4G phone by a large margin, but it was the most profitable by a large margin.\\n\\nApple pursued a similar strategy with Apple Watch, which delivered micro-sized silicon for wearables that were solidly ahead of its competition, despite Android Wear, Galaxy Gear and other platforms jumping into the smartwatch business multiple years ahead of Apple. Apple accomplished this through a media blitz that successfully sold large volumes of Apple Watch, funding rapid annual iterations that could get much better, far faster than all of the various watch concepts floated out in dabbling volumes that couldn\\'t pay for their future.\\n\\nThat was only possible because Apple did enough work ahead of time to make Apple Watch 1.0 appealing enough to users to justify its price tag. Apple sold many more wearables at $350 and up than its competitors could with their own, less capable, less finished devices that were trying to sell for around $150. That\\'s why they had no future while Apple Watch is now delivering advanced feats in Series 5.\\n\\nApple Watch also laid a foundation for technology used in iPhone X.\\n\\nPretty clearly, Apple\\'s core competency involves building out a shippable product that can justify its price. That\\'s something its competitors are clearly failing to do. Some are selling larger volumes of much cheaper devices like $300 Android phones and $15 Xiaomi bands and more expensive devices in tiny quantities like the $1,600 and up folding flip phones. Neither category are achieving the kind of success Apple is regularly capturing with new releases that appear to be perfectly priced to drive the volume of sales Apple needs to both profit now and to pay for its next generation of developments.\\n\\nRegardless of your personal opinion of Apple, it is inarguably clear that the company is -- and has been -- doing the best job of financing the future of consumer technology: a combination of product design, software development, effective marketing, and global operations capable of delivering the right product at the right time at an acceptable price for a critical mass of buyers. In addition to leveraging its trailing position to leap competitors in volume pricing, Apple has also used exclusive, expensive new technologies to advance itself ahead of lower-priced commodity. Apple has consistently made a compelling case for the public to buy its products since iPod.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t just the first model of iPhone that had people standing in line. Every year Apple\\'s next iPhone laid out a proposition that tens of millions of regular consumers couldn\\'t refuse. Each new iPad and Mac has achieved strong sales, and Apple has recently crafted new reasons to own Apple Watch or AirPods, entirely new product categories that barely existed before Apple turned them into mass-market success stories.\\n\\nEverything Apple does is not necessarily a blockbuster success, but even its marginal \"hobby\" projects such as Apple TV and HomePod bring in billions of dollars even in markets where its competitors are desperately giving products away tied to a surveillance advertising business model, such as Roku, Fire, Vizio, and Alexa devices.\\n\\nYet, if folding displays and 5G-- both of which appear to have obvious intrinsic appeal, at least on a conceptual level-- can\\'t manage to grab users\\' attention at the prices they currently demand, how can it be possible that Apple\\'s foray into Augmented Reality will ever sustain itself? That\\'s the emerging media narrative voiced by pundits who are still stridently, desperately contorting logical loopholes trying to depict Apple as potentially failing in some respect.\\n\\nTechCrunch recently announced that \"consumers just don\\'t see anything they want yet\\' in the field of AR, but that doesn\\'t become true with mere repetition. One could say the same thing about bitmapped fonts in 1985.\\n\\nApple is selling LiDAR this year as a compelling story for iPad Pro, and we expect, iPhone 12 later this year. LiDAR works similarly to the front-facing TrueDepth sensor, but rather than being optimized for the face, it allows users to scan a depth-accurate depiction of their surroundings.\\n\\nThe concept isn\\'t new. A few months after Apple acquired PrimeSense in 2013, we detailed how the 3D scanning \"structure sensor\" technology it acquired could be used to scan models of objects. And before that, other companies that partnered with PrimeSense used the technology to power such concepts as Microsoft\\'s Kinect for body motion tracking used in video games and \"natural interaction\" applications, effectively fully body gestures.\\n\\nIn the years since, Google dabbled with partners under Project Tango, which added a rear depth camera system to various Android phablets that failed to gain any traction in the market. As with many of the things Google does, Tango was released the way Apple did things in the 1990s: partner with various big manufactures, whip up hype about nebulous features, then release it as a tacked-on technology on otherwise unremarkable devices that can\\'t compete with standard devices at market prices. Then after failing, simply abandon everything and allow others to benefit from your mistakes!\\n\\nDespite years of dabbling with a rear 3D sensor on mobile devices, Google shelved Tango just after Apple released its 1.0 vision for ARKit. Google then copied ARKit, the same way it dumped its own earlier Google Pay efforts to copy Apple Pay with Android Pay. Or the way Google dropped its initial Android efforts to deliver a new version of Android modeled closely after iOS.\\n\\nRather than trying to promise everything in its first release of ARKit, Apple focused the 3D camera on the user, and released several useful, real-world features for that technology, including Animojis and Selfie Portrait mode, and later Portrait Lighting AR effects. Apple\\'s TrueDepth implementation was not only functional and delivered some clear benefits, but was also a part of a series of other alluring features delivered in iPhone X.\\n\\nApple\\'s ability to take a single aspect of PrimeSense technology and deliver it as part of an attractive overall package resulted in a huge leap in sales and profits that helped pay for new generations of iPhone X: the less expensive, mass-market iPhone XR, the luxurious iPhone XS, and this year\\'s pairing of iPhone 11 and its Pro counterparts. Further, the technical work Apple did to advance its ARKit frameworks-- which handle things like identifying surfaces, occlusion of people, and realistic rendering effects that make augmented reality graphics blend seamlessly into camera video-- continues to adapt to take advantage of new hardware like the new LiDAR.\\n\\nLiDAR on the iPad Pro adds specialized hardware to perform rapid, accurate depth imaging that makes ARKit work that much better, expanding its capabilities. It\\'s a bit like putting glasses on a genius child, who can now use their innate visual cortex functions even more efficiently and with greater clarity, unlocking new abilities to analyze the world and enjoy life. In the same fashion, LiDAR hardware makes ARKit software and the apps that use it work even better and do new things that are either less practical or not at all possible with standard camera sensors.\\n\\nLiDAR will be an even greater game-changer on iPhone, as it will dramatically expand the installed base of LiDAR-capable users. In one year, Apple will have many tens of millions of users on LiDAR-equipped hardware, enabling a base for developers to take advantage of its features. One of the largest problems for Google\\'s Tango was that developers had no incentive to code specifically for it, because the hardware to use it was only installed on a few niche models. There was never any realistic hope that large numbers of Android users would end up with Tango phones because the main attraction to Android is cheapness.\\n\\nBy rapidly adding LiDAR hardware across its product line, Apple will further differentiate iOS and establish its platforms as the way to develop cutting edge AR applications empowered by LiDAR\\'s \"time of flight\" sensing data. The obvious next big step for AR is shifting advanced depth imaging sensors to display computer-generated graphics on a lens you look through, rather than just mixing them with video to create a composite, \"augmented\" depiction of reality.\\n\\nWith development attached to Apple\\'s software and the unique hardware of its installed base, it will be very difficult for rivals to ship out anything comparable.\\n\\nIt took Android makers years just to add fingerprint sensors, and during that rollout they got all sorts of things wrong. Notably, many early fingerprint sensors on Android stored that sensitive data irresponsibly in a way that malware could potentially access. The shape of your walls and the layout of objects inside your house or company office are similarly sensitive data that needs to be maintained in private. Yet Apple is alone in marketing the idea that it doesn\\'t need to collect your data and try to make some money off of analyzing it and selling details about you.\\n\\nAs with \"smart\" televisions that watch you, AR and LiDAR sensor data should be tied to premium hardware capable of offering you security and privacy, not just collected without any thought to where it might end up.\\n\\nAll of these things add up to a strategy closely aligned with Apple\\'s strategic vision for computational photography, Visual Inertial Odometry, and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping), the technology that builds out a map of the world that your depth camera system \"perceives\" around you as you use it. Right now, LiDAR means instantaneous AR and object modeling. Over the next few years, expect ARKit to jump off the device display to be projected right into your vision, allowing you immediate augmented data about the world around you.\\n\\nAnd before that happens, expect Apple and its third-party partners to offer an increasing array of compelling AR apps for mobile devices. These can deliver more immersive gaming, more personal shopping-- where furnishings can be virtually placed in your home, garments can be virtually draped over your body, and enhancements can be displayed over your home or landscaping-- and customized mapping that provides crosstown routing, campus navigation, inside directions to an ATM, and the location of lost objects using NFC and Ultrawideband devices. Companies are already using AR in employee training and other valuable applications, and educators are seeing real value in grabbing the attention of students with AR.\\n\\nWhat\\'s making all of this progress available is the free market for consumer devices that rewards innovation with profits. Last year\\'s precision engineering work by Samsung to deliver its technically advanced but wildly impractical Galaxy Fold was not similarly rewarded. Google\\'s advanced camera features for Pixel 4 and some smart ideas that went into Andy Rubin\\'s Essential were also not rewarded. Microsoft\\'s interesting conceptual ideas for Surface devices were not really rewarded.\\n\\nWhat was rewarded were AirPods Pro, Apple Watch, iPad, MacBooks, and to the greatest extreme iPhone 11, the most profitable device of the last season. A major aspect of iPhone 11\\'s broad allure was its computational photography, which LiDAR has the power to further enhance in obvious ways.\\n\\nApple\\'s critics keep vilifying the company\\'s profitability as if they\\'re trying to make the case that being paid for hard work is immoral. That\\'s absurd and it\\'s wrong. Apple is only currently performing well commercially because it is doing a better job at delivering better technology in a better package at the right time at an acceptable cost to consumers. Apple doesn\\'t have an enforceable monopoly on phones or wearables or tablets or earbuds. If its competitors were also doing a better job, they\\'d also be similarly profitable. But they are not and Apple is.\\n\\nLiDAR is the latest evidence of Apple\\'s competency in delivering, not just announcing, advanced technology at the right price.',\n",

Their stories deserve to be told and heard. In my opinion, there is more work to be done on the film to illuminate the full scope of what the victims endured, and it has become clear that the filmmakers and I are not aligned in that creative vision. Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering are talented filmmakers. I have great respect for their mission but given the filmmakers\\' desire to premiere the film at the Sundance Film Festival before I believe it is complete, I feel it\\'s best to step aside. I will be working with Time\\'s Up to support the victims and those impacted by abuse and sexual harassment.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: As a result of Oprah leaving the project, it will no longer appear on Apple TV+. We will leave this entry here for a time as a record.\\n\\nBillie Eilish documentary\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: Global pop sensation Billie Eilish is only 17 and has already landed a number one album and a host of awards, including Artist of the Year in Apple\\'s first ever Apple Music Awards.

It is written and directed by Benjamin Cleary.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: Swan Song has no theatrical or streaming release date yet.\\n\\nSlow Horses\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: When the British MI-5 agency\\'s spies screw up their career, they are sent to the \"Slough House\" to while away their days doing unimportant work. They are referred to by the rest of the agency as \"Slow Horses,\" hence the TV show title. There are more than six books in Mick Herron\\'s \"Slough House\" series, with more on the way.\\n\\nImportant names: Gary Oldman is to star (he doesn\\'t do a lot of TV!) as Jackson Lamb, the leader of the Slough House spies.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: Slow Horses does not yet have a release date.\\n\\nSeverance\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: According to The Hollywood Reporter, Severance is a workplace thriller that is set at Lumen Industries, a company looking to take work-life balance to a new level.

Patricia Arquette will play Mark\\'s boss.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: Severance does not yet have a release date.\\n\\nA Christmas Carol\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: A musical adaptation of A Christmas Carol starring Will Ferrell and Ryan Reynolds. You know: Scrooge, three ghosts, Bah Humbug, etc...\\n\\nImportant names: Will Ferrell and Ryan Reynolds star.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: No release date has been set, but it\\'s either going to come out for Christmas 2019 (not likely) or Christmas 2020. I mean, it\\'s A Christmas Carol. There\\'s about a one-month window each year where it makes any sense to release it.\\n\\nEl Gato Negro\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: Based on Richard Dominguez\\'s comic book about an aging luchador who teams up with his grandson to use the El Gato Negro persona to fight crime in South Texas.\\n\\nImportant names: Robert Rodriguez will direct and produce, while Diego Boneta will star and also produce.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: El Gato Negro does not yet have a release date.\\n\\nMasters of the Air\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: A limited series about the bombers of World War II. It is something of a follow-up to the hit HBO series Band of Brothers. Nearly all of the content on Apple TV+, while original and exclusive, is produced by outside production companies and studios. But according to Variety, Apple is also building its own internal studio, named Masters, and this is its first project.\\n\\nImportant names: It will be written by one of Band of Brothers writers, John Orloff, with Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks once again on as executive producers. Several other producers and alumni of Band of Brothers will be involved with the project, too.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: Masters of the Air does not yet have a release date, but as it has just been greenlit and has not entered full production, it is likely not coming soon.\\n\\nTed Lasso\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: About six years ago, NBC Sports produced a video starring Jason Sudeikis as an American football coach who goes to coach soccer in the U.K., despite knowing nothing about the game. The coach, Ted Lasso, thinks of everything in American Football terms, and hilarity ensues. The original video was just a promotional effort to show that NBC Sports was going to start showing English Premiere League games.\\n\\nImportant names: Jason Sudeikis is the big star here.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: It was just greenlit in the fall of 2019, so it will probably be a while.\\n\\nFoundation\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: Of all of Isaac Asimov\\'s famous science fiction work, none is as sprawling, weighty, or influential as the Foundation series. The original book trilogy (part of which was originally published as a short story series in sci-fi magazine Astounding) was published in the 1950s, and has served as influential fodder for a lot of the science fiction that followed.\\n\\nImportant names: The Hollywood Reporter says that stars Lee Pace and Jared Harris will star in the series.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: Foundation does not yet have a release date.\\n\\nSwagger\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: Apple is developing a drama series inspired by the early life and career of NBA superstar Kevin Durant and his youth basketball experiences.

Winston Duke was originally cast in the lead role, but he suffered an injury on set and couldn\\'t continue. O\\'Shea Jackson Jr. (Ice Cube in Straight Outta Compton) will take over the lead role.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: Swagger does not yet have a projected release date, but the on-set injury of the lead actor, and his replacement, probably means a lot of re-shoots.\\n\\nThe Sky is Everywhere\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: According to a report from The Hollywood Reporter, Apple has teamed up with indie production company A24 to produce a film adaptation of the young adult novel The Sky is Everywhere.\\n\\nThe novel tells the story of a high school girl whose older sister suddenly dies. She forms a relationship with her sister\\'s former fiancé and also with the new boy in town, who loves music as she does. Amid the coping with the loss of her sister, she has to choose between these two romantic entanglements.\\n\\nImportant names: Josephine Decker will direct and produce, and author Jandy Nelson will write the screen adaptation of her own book.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: The Sky is Everywhere does not yet have a release date.\\n\\nThe Mosquito Coast\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: A report in Variety says that Apple has ordered an adaptation of the novel The Mosquito Coast, to star Justin Theroux.

The book will be adapted for TV by Neil Cross.\\n\\nImportant names: Justin Theroux, nephew of author Paul Theroux, will star.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: The Mosquito Coast has no release date, but if it was just ordered it will probably be some time.\\n\\nMr. Corman\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: Variety says that Apple has picked up a new drama series called Mr. Corman that is written by, produced by, and stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The series revolves around an elementary school teacher struggling to cope with life as an adult in Los Angeles.\\n\\nImportant names: Joseph Gordon-Levitt will write, star in, and produce the series.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: The series has no known release date yet.\\n\\nLisey\\'s Story\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: It\\'s an eight episode miniseries adaptation of the Stephen King novel of the same name, and Stephen King himself will write all episodes of the series -- that\\'s quite rare.\\n\\nImportant names: According to The Hollywood Reporter, the series will star Julianne Moore. The series will be produced by J.J. Abrams\\' production company Bad Robot, though besides getting an executive producer credit, it doesn\\'t appear Abrams will be directly involved.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: Lisey\\'s Story has no release date yet. It\\'s very likely to be 2020 before it\\'s ready for streaming.\\n\\nPrehistoric Planet\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: Apple has ordered a new natural history series from Jon Favreau and Mike Gunton. The CGI-heavy series will be produced by BBC Studios\\' Natural History Unit, and will follow the last days of the dinosaurs.\\n\\nImportant names: Jon Favreau made waves using CG animals in The Jungle Book and The Lion King, and Mike Gunton produced Planet Earth II.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: Prehistoric Planet does not yet have a release date.\\n\\nBrie Larson CIA biography series\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: A report in Variety says that Apple has made a direct-to-series order for a new drama based on the real life experiences of CIA undercover operative Amaryllis Fox.

We\\'re not likely to see this one until sometime in 2020 or beyond.\\n\\nSimon Kinberg and David Weil sci-fi series\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: According to Deadline, Apple has committed to a 10-episode season of a new science fiction series. We don\\'t know much about the plot, though.

Kinberg is known for his work on the Fox X-Men franchise, and Weil is the creator of the upcoming Amazon Nazi-hunting series The Hunt.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: It appears to be very early days on the production -- we don\\'t know what is will be called, what it is about, who will star in it, or when it will be released. This seems like it\\'s likely to be a 2020 (or later) release.\\n\\nOn the Rocks\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: According to Variety, the film follows a young mother who reconnects with her larger-than-life playboy father on an adventure through New York.\\n\\nImportant names: The film will be written and directed by Sofia Coppola, and star Bill Murray and Rashida Jones.

Abrams through his Bad Robot production company.\\n\\nImportant names: J.J. Abrams and Jennifer Garner are working together again for the first time since the show Alias.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: The series does not yet have a release date.\\n\\nLosing Earth\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: This summer, The New York Times Magazine published an epic feature titled, \"Losing Earth: The Decade We Almost Stopped Climate Change.\" At over 30,000 words, it took up an entire issue of the magazine and earned critical acclaim. It focused on how, from 1979 to 1989, a small team of scientists, activists, and politicians tried to stop climate change while there was still time.\\n\\nWe don\\'t know the format the show will take, but The New York Times specifically calls it a \"series.\" Based on the source material, it seems like a single-season limited series makes the most sense.\\n\\nImportant names: The article\\'s author, Nathaniel Rich, will serve as executive producer together with Anonymous Content founder and CEO Steve Golin.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: Losing Earth (if that will be the final title) has no release date yet.\\n\\nWolfwalkers\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: Irish animation studio Cartoon Saloon produces this tale about a young hunter who comes to Ireland with her father to wipe out the last pack of evil wolves, but instead befriends a wild native girl who runs with them.\\n\\nImportant names: The film comes from Tomm Moore, who has been nominated for two Oscars for animated films.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: Wolfwalkers does not yet have a release date.\\n\\nPachinko\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: The best-selling novel Pachinko follows four generations of a Korean immigrant family, following the line from Korea to Japan and finally America. The New York Times named it one of the 10 best books of 2017.\\n\\nAccording to Variety, Apple has secured the rights to develop Min Jin Lee\\'s novel into a series. A later report in The Hollywood Reporter stated that Apple has moved from simply optioning the novel to ordering a full eight episodes. It\\'s not clear if it\\'s a single season of a multi-season arc, or just an eight-episode miniseries.\\n\\nImportant names: It will be written and directed by Soo Hugh, who was the showrunner for the first season of AMC\\'s The Terror.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: Pachinko does not yet have a release date.\\n\\nTime Bandits\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: Terry Gilliam\\'s time-traveling adventure comedy Time Bandits may make its way to the small screen in a TV series. Deadline reports that Apple is buying up the rights to make a TV show of the cult classic film.\\n\\nThe film, about a young boy who gets caught up with a troupe of thieves as they hop across history to steal treasure, ever on the run from the \"supreme being\" from whom they\\'ve stolen their time map, is good fodder for a TV show. But the film has a dedicated cult following who will place high demands on maintaining the film\\'s heart and quirky sense of British humor.\\n\\nImportant names: Terry Gilliam will have an executive producer role, but will not write for the show. A report in Variety says that the series will be directed by Taika Waititi, whose quirky film What We Do in the Shadows earned him a cult following, and who earned huge international acclaim for his direction of Thor: Rangrarok and Jojo Rabbit.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: Time Bandits (if that\\'s even the show\\'s name) does not yet have a release date.\\n\\nCalls\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: On the French premium cable channel Canal+ you\\'ll find a new series named Calls. It\\'s ten-episode arc for the first season consists of ten-minute episodes. Each consists of a playback of an audio recording -- an airplane black box, a voicemail, a 911 call -- that depict some sort of tragedy. They all tie to together to tell the story of some sort of impending apocalypse.\\n\\nIt\\'s a neat idea, if a somewhat odd format. According to Variety, Apple has now bought the rights to make an English-language version, along with the rights to the first season of the French version. You can see a trailer for the French version below.\\n\\nImportant names: We don\\'t know who will star, direct, or produce the English-language version for Apple.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: Calls has no release date yet.\\n\\nShantaram\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: The hit novel Shantaram has a somewhat tumultuous history in Hollywood. According to Variety, the book was first to be developed as a film, with Johnny Depp having acquired the book rights and Warner Bros. producing with Joel Edgerton in the starring role. Then, the plans were scrapped and the rights auctioned off, with Anonymous Content and Paramount Television winning the rights to Shantaram and its sequel novel The Mountain Shadow.\\n\\nGregory David Roberts\\' novel tells the story of Lin, an escaped convict from a maximum security Australian prison. On the run and cut off from friends and family, he disappears into the Bombay underground in India.\\n\\nImportant names: Eric Warren Singer (American Hustle, The International) will write and executive produce the series. According to a report from Variety, the lead character will be payed by Charlie Hunnam, who is known for his work on Sons of Anarchy and for starring in Pacific Rim.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: Shantaram does not yet have a release date.\\n\\nYou Think It, I\\'ll Say It\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: According to Variety, Apple has ordered a 10-episode, half-hour run of a new comedy variety show. The show is inspired by Curtis Sittenfeld\\'s collection of short stories You Think It, I\\'ll Say It.\\n\\nImportant names: SNL alum Kristen Wiig was set to star, but pulled out citing scheduling conflicts with Wonder Woman 1984. The show is created and produced by Colleen McGuinness (30 Rock, About a Boy).\\n\\nWhen you can watch: This project does not yet have a title or release date.\\n\\nDamien Chazelle drama series\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: According to Variety, Apple has gone straight-to-series (ordered a whole season of a series without first shooting a pilot) on a drama by Damien Chazelle. Chazelle is the acclaimed writer and director of La La Land and Whiplash, and is currently working on a Neil Armstrong biopic called First Man.\\n\\nNo details have been given about the series at all, except that Chazelle will write and direct every episode. We don\\'t know the subject matter, the stars, the length of each episode...really nothing at all.\\n\\nImportant names: Chazelle is the acclaimed writer and director of La La Land and Whiplash, and is currently working on a Neil Armstrong biopic called First Man.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: There is no release date set for this series.\\n\\nNote: When you purchase something after clicking links in our articles, we may earn a small commission.

       "    'title': \"Looking back on ten years from the iPad, Apple's revolutionary tablet\",\n",
       "    'body': 'Apple iPads are powerful and versatile machines. But to understand how they became, it is good to look at their past.\\n\\nWith support for touch panels, remodeled file systems and no shortage of computing power, the latest iPad Pro lineup is a serious competitor in usability for almost any task on any hybrid or touch screen laptop out there. However, this has not always been the case.\\n\\nLong before the first iPhone, Apple experimented with tablet-like form factors and devices such as Newton MessagePad PDAs or prototype hardware like PenLite (pictured above), a PowerBook based tablet.\\n\\nNone of these devices turned into iPad or really found much commercial success. Apple continued to work with the concept and eventually produced a new prototype of multitouch tablets in 2004. Although originally planned to launch before the first iPhone, Apple\\'s management eventually decided that the smartphone was more important.\\n\\nThe original iPhone debuted in 2007. Almost immediately after its release, rumors began that Apple had some type of tablet in the works, and AppleInsider was one of the first places to talk about it. Just three years filled with furious speculation later, the late Apple CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs unveiled the very first iPad on January 27, 2010 at the Yerba Buena Center in San Francisco.\\n\\nApple\\'s original iPad, announced in January 2010, landed in public hands on April 3. The first version featured a 9.7-inch display, an Apple A4 processor and up to 10 hours of battery life. It started at $ 499, with storage options topped out at 64 GB, and interestingly, with square off-edges similar to today\\'s iPad Pro.\\n\\nBut while it may seem pretty archaic by today\\'s standards - the device didn\\'t even have a camera - the original iPad tablet announced the age of the average consumer after a decade of half-baked ideas on the Windows side. Apple sold about 300,000 at launch, and on May 3, it reached that number one million. At the end of 2010, iPad\\'s Mac sales surpassed quarterly.\\n\\nReleased about a year after the original iPad, iPad 2 was truly a refinement of Apple\\'s tablet ambitions. It was lighter, thinner, packed an A5 chip with two cores and introduced support for Smart Covers. It was important that it was also the first tablet to play a camera back and forth.\\n\\nIt is likely that the device will help realize what a tablet was from Apple\\'s perspective. It became a cornerstone of Apple\\'s line, eventually backed by six different versions of iOS, and it was really the first iPad specifically marketed for the education sector.\\n\\nThe gradually updated iPad 3 came in 2012 and played pretty much the same design as its predecessor. The primary upgrade was a Retina display that offered four times the pixel count for iPad 2. It also included an improved 5MP camera, an A5X chipset and localized LTE support\\n\\nThings started to change for Apple\\'s surf platform later in 2012. Several months after the debut of the third-generation iPad, Apple released a fourth-generation sporting an A6X chip, FaceTime HD and a Lightning port - becoming the first iPad to ditch 30 pins.\\n\\nIt was an extremely quick update to all standards, and many reviewers found it difficult to recommend the fourth-generation iPad to consumers who had just purchased the previous iPad months earlier. Apple eventually launched iPad 4 2014 after temporarily ceasing it.\\n\\nIn addition to \"the new iPad\", Apple also launched the iPad mini, a tablet with similar specifications as the iPad 2 but with a smaller 7.9-inch footprint. Although it was originally launched to stave off such things as Amazon Kindles and Google Nexus tablets, it also marked the first time Apple really diversified the iPad range.\\n\\nApple redesigned iPad again in 2013 with iPad Air, the first tablet sold under that moniker. It included upgraded cameras, narrower frames and an A7 processor in combination with an M7 motion co-processor. It was also by its name much thinner and lighter than the iPad 2.\\n\\nThe Cupertino company also released a new iPad mini at the same time, though it was a subdued update with the only main feature being a Retina display.\\n\\nA year later, in 2014, Apple released iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3. Both tablets contained Touch ID for the first time, and Air 2 was updated to a triple-core A8X CPU and 2 GB of RAM. Then, the popularity of the iPad began to decline before big phones like the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.\\n\\nIf you were to try to track the start of Apple\\'s current tablet strategy, 2015 would be a good place to start. In a bid to revitalize the iPad, Apple released the very first iPad Pro in September 2015.\\n\\nIt was a 12.9-inch tablet with an A9X processor, 4GB of RAM and the very first Smart Connector port, which allowed users to connect the tablet to the Smart Keyboard without Bluetooth. Alongside the new Pro unit, Apple also unveiled the first Apple Pencil, an advanced pen with low latency, angle detection and pressure sensitivity.\\n\\nApple also released an iPad mini 4 at the same time. With an A8 processor and 2 GB of RAM, the device would be the last iteration of Apple\\'s mini tablets for a while.\\n\\nA smaller iPad Pro, first equipped with a 9.7-inch screen, was later released in March 2016. Although essentially a smaller version of the 12.9-inch model, it included some unique features and add-ons, including True Tone display technology and a rose gold color alternative.\\n\\nThis was also the time when Apple began to differentiate iOS for iPad from iOS for iPhone. iOS 9 introduced new multitasking features like Split View, Slide Over and Picture in Picture, hinting at what was to come.\\n\\nApple quietly announced the fifth-generation iPad in March 2017 and released the Air moniker for a time. But despite the name change, the iPad level still had the same design - although a bit thicker. However, it contained a price drop and upgraded internals.\\n\\nThere were also two new iPad Pro models in 2017. The most important update was the smallest of the two, which was up to a 10.5-inch screen with 40% narrower frames and a 120Hz refresh rate.\\n\\nThe 10.5-inch iPad Pro has 30% faster performance and 40% better graphics than its predecessor, thanks to a new A10X and M10 co-processor. The 12.9-inch had similar upgrades, but its footprint remained the same as its predecessor.\\n\\nApple took another shot at the iPad Pro 2018, and it turned out to be a major upgrade. The now 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro received the \"iPhone X\" treatment with uniform and ultra-thin frames. They also fixed the home button in favor of Face ID and gesture-based controls.\\n\\nThe major review also saw the Lightning connector replaced with a USB-C port, as well as the introduction of a new generation Apple Pencil connected to an iPad Pro and charged magnetically. Internally, the units have an A12 Bionic chipset, a new Liquid Retina display, upgraded cameras and storage capacity up to 1 TB for the first time.\\n\\nThe base iPad for 2018, by comparison, was a step-by-step upgrade. It played essentially the same design as we\\'ve seen since iPad Air 2. While it missed most modern iPad Pro features, it remained significantly cheaper than most Apple tablets and included an upgraded A10 chip and Apple Pencil support.\\n\\nIn 2019, we saw one of the largest expansions of the wider iPad stable to date. Apple released a total of three new iPads across the range: a new base model iPad, an iPad mini and the first iPad Air since 2014.\\n\\nThe third-generation iPad Air was essentially a 10.5-inch iPad Pro successor. With a mid-range price point, the iPad Air has serious power for money with support for the first generation Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard.\\n\\nApple\\'s new iPad mini, unofficially the iPad mini 5, is also essentially an iPad Pro in another form factor. It contained the same 7.9-inch screen and home button as the latest iPad mini, but packs Apple\\'s latest silicon and other internal upgrades under the hood.\\n\\nApple also released a new IP level with a 10.2-inch display, by far the most affordable tablet. Around this time, Apple also split its tablet OS operating system, which included some exclusive multitasking features separated from iOS, such as the ability to open multiple windows in the same app or better text editing features.\\n\\nWhile the undercurrents have been around for at least a couple of years, 2020 really marks the first time the iPad became somewhat more akin to a computer than a tablet.\\n\\nThe iPad Pro models in 2020 remained relatively unchanged from their predecessors in 2018, sporting with the same general design and specifications. The addition of a LiDAR sensor, a new A12Z Bionic chipset and an 8-core GPU are some of the most important upgrades.\\n\\nBut something else happened in 2020 that really changed things for Apple tablets: the introduction of full trackpad and mouse support. In addition to a new smart keyboard with touchpad accessories, Apple introduced full support for pointing devices in iPadOS 13.4.\\n\\nIt marks a departure from Apple\\'s previous strategy. While iOS and iPadOS 13 contained mouse support, it was buried in availability. Now it\\'s front and center. Apple even expanded that support to non-Pro tablets, and Logitech debuted touchpad options for the iPad and iPad Air boot levels.\\n\\nAnd more than anything else, it really does indicate that Apple sees the iPad Pro range as a serious competitor to actual laptops and two-in-one hybrids. While some obstacles remain, such as a suspended file system, Apple tablets are more like a computer than they have ever been before.\\n\\nTo understand how the original iPad or iPad Pro stacks up to today\\'s offerings, just look at the specifications. The original iPad is far from the current model. Although things have obviously changed less for the iPad Pro since it has only been available for half of the iPad\\'s ten years, we have still seen major updates during that time.\\n\\nApart from the iPad and iPad Pro, Apple\\'s other tablets have also evolved over the last ten years. Take a look at the specifications of the original iPad mini and iPad Air and compare them with the current iterations on the tablets.\\n\\nThe latest iPad Pro models and iPadOS paint a clear direction for Apple tablets. Not designed to replace the Mac, they offer an alternative computing experience. And while Apple doesn\\'t want iPad to cannibalize the sale of its MacBooks, it undoubtedly wants Windows hybrid owners to ditch their notebooks for iPad Pros.\\n\\nThis is significant because the iPad has been in the midst of an identity crisis, and as early as 2018, some analysts thought of Apple\\'s tablet as a dying product. But add-ons like platform apps, deeper multitasking, better file system access and touchpad support have enabled iPadOS to find its footing.\\n\\nMore computer-like improvements are coming. Some rumors suggest that Apple will allow users to choose third-party apps as their iOS 14 standards, expected later this year. It has been a feature of desktop operating systems like macOS. In the midst of rumors about ARM Mac machines, it is likely that the work with platform apps will only get faster.\\n\\nAs far as hardware goes from here, Apple is rumored to release 5G-compatible iPads sometime in 2020, and there is little doubt that the iPad is still a central part of Apple\\'s broader reality strategy.\\n\\nIn other words, the current iPad is a device that is a decade to make. And it doesn\\'t look anywhere in the next.',\n",

A later report in The Hollywood Reporter stated that Apple has moved from simply optioning the novel to ordering a full eight episodes. It\\'s not clear if it\\'s a single season of a multi-season arc, or just an eight-episode miniseries.\\n\\nImportant names: It will be written and directed by Soo Hugh, who was the showrunner for the first season of AMC\\'s The Terror.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: Pachinko does not yet have a release date.\\n\\nTime Bandits\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: Terry Gilliam\\'s time-traveling adventure comedy Time Bandits may make its way to the small screen in a TV series. Deadline reports that Apple is buying up the rights to make a TV show of the cult classic film.\\n\\nThe film, about a young boy who gets caught up with a troupe of thieves as they hop across history to steal treasure, ever on the run from the \"supreme being\" from whom they\\'ve stolen their time map, is good fodder for a TV show. But the film has a dedicated cult following who will place high demands on maintaining the film\\'s heart and quirky sense of British humor.\\n\\nImportant names: Terry Gilliam will have an executive producer role, but will not write for the show. A report in Variety says that the series will be directed by Taika Waititi, whose quirky film What We Do in the Shadows earned him a cult following, and who earned huge international acclaim for his direction of Thor: Rangrarok and Jojo Rabbit.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: Time Bandits (if that\\'s even the show\\'s name) does not yet have a release date.\\n\\nCalls\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: On the French premium cable channel Canal+ you\\'ll find a new series named Calls. It\\'s ten-episode arc for the first season consists of ten-minute episodes. Each consists of a playback of an audio recording -- an airplane black box, a voicemail, a 911 call -- that depict some sort of tragedy. They all tie to together to tell the story of some sort of impending apocalypse.\\n\\nIt\\'s a neat idea, if a somewhat odd format. According to Variety, Apple has now bought the rights to make an English-language version, along with the rights to the first season of the French version. You can see a trailer for the French version below.\\n\\nImportant names: We don\\'t know who will star, direct, or produce the English-language version for Apple.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: Calls has no release date yet.\\n\\nShantaram\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: The hit novel Shantaram has a somewhat tumultuous history in Hollywood. According to Variety, the book was first to be developed as a film, with Johnny Depp having acquired the book rights and Warner Bros. producing with Joel Edgerton in the starring role. Then, the plans were scrapped and the rights auctioned off, with Anonymous Content and Paramount Television winning the rights to Shantaram and its sequel novel The Mountain Shadow.\\n\\nGregory David Roberts\\' novel tells the story of Lin, an escaped convict from a maximum security Australian prison. On the run and cut off from friends and family, he disappears into the Bombay underground in India.\\n\\nImportant names: Eric Warren Singer (American Hustle, The International) will write and executive produce the series.

The show is inspired by Curtis Sittenfeld\\'s collection of short stories You Think It, I\\'ll Say It.\\n\\nImportant names: SNL alum Kristen Wiig was set to star, but pulled out citing scheduling conflicts with Wonder Woman 1984. The show is created and produced by Colleen McGuinness (30 Rock, About a Boy).\\n\\nWhen you can watch: This project does not yet have a title or release date.\\n\\nDamien Chazelle drama series\\n\\nWhat it\\'s about: According to Variety, Apple has gone straight-to-series (ordered a whole season of a series without first shooting a pilot) on a drama by Damien Chazelle. Chazelle is the acclaimed writer and director of La La Land and Whiplash, and is currently working on a Neil Armstrong biopic called First Man.\\n\\nNo details have been given about the series at all, except that Chazelle will write and direct every episode. We don\\'t know the subject matter, the stars, the length of each episode...really nothing at all.\\n\\nImportant names: Chazelle is the acclaimed writer and director of La La Land and Whiplash, and is currently working on a Neil Armstrong biopic called First Man.\\n\\nWhen you can watch: There is no release date set for this series.\\n\\nNote: When you purchase something after clicking links in our articles, we may earn a small commission.

       "    'title': 'Apple ID Phishing Scam  --  WHAT IS IT + How to Remove',\n",
       "    'body': 'The Apple ID Phishing Scam is a popular malware tactic that attempts to manipulate Apple users into infecting themselves with viruses or disclosing their passwords. At the moment we do not have information about the perpetrators behind it. Our article gives an in-depth explanation of how it propagates and how victims can attempt to remove active infections.\\n\\nIn April 2020 phishing attacks using the social engineering strategy of impersonating Apple ID messages continues. An unknown hacking group is behind the attacks. It is spread via email messages which are sent in bulk. Infected computers and web mail servers are sending out notifications that manipulate the recipients into thinking that their accounts have been locked by Apple. The users will be redirected to a hacker-controlled page, in most cases the addresses are configured to be phishing login pages. The main goal of the hackers are to hijack the credentials of the victims.\\n\\nThe Apple ID phishing scam is distributed using various methods. The main one is the creation of sites that share a similar name to Apple and their services. They are distributed using various methods:\\n\\nNote that the Apple phishing ID landing page can be displayed by software and files as well. A prime example is the modified software installer -- the criminals take the setup files of popular software and add to them the code that shows the phishing page. The other type is the creation of infected documents that can be of any popular type: rich text documents, presentations, databases and spreadsheets. When they are opened a prompt will appear asking the users to enable the built-in scripts. When this is done the links will be opened in a browser window or directly as an embedded object.\\n\\nIn some cases the hackers can also make use of malware browser extensions, alternatively known as hijackers. The criminals make them compatible with the most popular web browsers in order to increase the number of victim users. They are frequently uploaded to the official hacker repositories using fake or stolen user reviews and developer credentials. The uploaded strains feature descriptions that promise the optimization of the browsers or the enhancement with newer features. If the users install them then the typical hijacker behavior will be observed. Direct effects are the manipulations of the web browsers into directly redirecting the users to the Apple ID phishing scam page. This is done by changing the default values -- home page, new tabs page and search engine.\\n\\nWhen the Apple ID phishing scam page is displayed to the users the basic view will show a login page that uses the design layout and elements of the real Apple site. The hackers manipulate the users into believing that a site belonging to the company is being accessed. Scams such as this one feature several distinct elements, one of the main ones is the fact that many copies of the page can be created. They can be hosted on servers around the world -- not all of them will be served on the same domains. From an administrator point of view this gives the hackers greater flexibility as they can easily deploy thousands of them in a short period of time. To further coerce the users into thinking that they are accessing real Apple pages they can use include security certificates and cross-site linking.\\n\\nThe main goal of the page is to coerce the users into revealing their account credentials to the site. They will be automatically transferred to the malicious operators of the Apple ID phishing scam site as soon as they are entered. However there are other malicious actions that may be executed. All of them are connected to the site interaction in some way or another.\\n\\nVisiting the sites can lead to the installation of tracking cookies and data collection modules. They will automatically hijack data both from the web browsers and the infected devices. There are two main categories of data that can be distinguished:\\n\\nThrough the various scripts the machines can be come infected with cryptocurrency miners as well. They represent applications that make use of the available system resources in order to run complex mathematical calculations. When the successful tasks are reported to the relevant servers the hacker operators will receive profit in the form of cryptocurrency. An additional consequence is the delivery of intrusive ads -- they can cause redirects to other malware sites or present links to sponsored content. In most cases all popular mechanisms can be used: pop-ups, banners, in-line links and etc.\\n\\nIf any file downloads are offered then practically all types of malicious payloads can be offered. The files themselves will probably be renamed with Apple related services, products and software. Beware that among the most frequently used strings used to rename such payloads include \"update\" and \"manual\". Common infections include the following:\\n\\nIn some cases scams like this one can be used to spread Trojan viruses. They represent advanced malware that set up a client service to a hacker-controlled server. The connection is made both secure and constant thus allowing the hackers to overtake control of the machines at any given time. This also includes the retrieval of user data, spying in real-time and deploying other viruses at will. Through it the hackers can also recruit the machines to botnet networks which are particularly useful for organizing distributed attacks against pre-selected targets.\\n\\nA wave of phishing Apple ID scams are being coordinated against end users using the subject line of \"Receipt Order\" following by information about a booking order with the company. This tactic attempts to confuse them into thinking that a made payment for Apple\\'s services has been processed and that information about the transaction is available in the attached payment receipt. The messages will have PDF file attachments which contain virus code in their macros or are direct samples. If the file is launched it will most likely lead to a dangerous infection.\\n\\nSecurity alerts indicate a new phishing scam making use of malicious web pages and social network messages as the main medium. We have received an email-based sample which is made to look like as it was sent by Apple. The message contents will include elements that may be mistaken for real data:\\n\\nThe message motions to the targets that a payment through Apple has been made quoting randomly-generated fields such as customer and order ID and the date of completion. This scam is deemed very effective as Apple payments are widely used in some areas and users might not be aware that this is a fraud notification. The email may insert links to various end pages. Some of the possible ones include the following:\\n\\nAn example message reads the following:\\n\\nApple Payment Payment Has Been Completelease check your Receipt Customer ID-899782.nice day Thursday, October 11,2018#95647\\n\\nto support@apple.com\\n\\nbcc @yahoo.com\\n\\ndate today at 2:15 PM\\n\\nApple Payment Receipt\\n\\nDancing Line By Cheetah Technology Corp. Limited Price $9.99 Order #MMJD56W68K Billed to: iTune Store Credit Name Products: Large Coin Box\\n\\nType:in-App Purchases\\n\\nPricing9.99\\n\\nPayment Method Credit iTune Store\\n\\nA recent wave of phishing email messages have been detected by researchers. According to the available reports the newest attack campaign is launched against users at a global scale. In it a contact address belonging to Apple has been spoofed (support.apple.com) and the subject line reads generic titles such as this one: [Reminder] Please Check Your Recent Activity 14425 wherein the number can be changed to a random one. No body contents is available and the users will see only an attached PDF file. They may be enticed into clicking on it which will lead to a malware infection.\\n\\nA new wave of phishing scams has been discovered in early January 2019 utilizing phone calls. The hackers will automate calls to the intended targets with spoofed company elements: logo, address and real phone number. The quoted trigger message delivered to the victims is that a data breach has occurred.\\n\\nWhen the targets call the number a man with Indian accent will pick up the phone and persuade them into thinking that they have called the legitimate Apple support line. If the users fall for the fraud call then their personal information will be gathered, as well as Apple account credentials. They may be guided into paying a \"security fee\".\\n\\nThis is another landing page based phishing scam which attempts to coerce the targets into revealing their account credentials. The page will copy Apple\\'s design and will probably be hosted on several domains that bear an almost identical name to Apple or any of its products. This is intentionally made to navigate the users into it if they accidentally mistype the legitimate address.\\n\\nWhile presenting a login page with links to real Apple pages is a classic approach, there are many ways through which it can spread. Depending on the actual means of distribution the outcome can vary. If several methods are used at once then there will be a very high number of potential victims. This Apple ID scam landing page is very likely to be found via shortened links that are sent via email messages and social network profiles (both posts and direct messages). The hackers can retrieve whole databases of base information and start the outbreak.\\n\\nA new scam related to the other Apple phishing campaigns has been detected. It is being distributed as a landing page that requests the victims to enter in their Apple ID details. There are several forms of possible source however we anticipate that email messages and payload carriers are the most likely delivery agents.\\n\\nThe landing page will not have a security certificate issued to Apple and users may find that some of the links will not lead to the Apple site. Bear in mind that landing pages like this one are also short-linked and uploaded to social media profiles that are either stolen or hacked. The user accounts are either hacked or stolen.\\n\\nThe hackers will send out a fake notification message that is created in a way that resembles Apple Support. Its body contents will persuade the recipients into believing that their Apple account is locked due to incorrect login attempts. To unlock them they are redirected to a fake login page which will request their email address and password combination. If they are entered the credentials will immediately be transferred to the hacker operators of the scam and they will take over he victim accounts.\\n\\nAnother Apple ID scam that has been identified is an email phishing tactic that manipulates the recipients into thinking that their Apple ID has been locked. Like the other examples it uses familiar Apple-like styling and presents a link to \"unblock\" the said accounts. When it is accessed it will lead to the same phishing landing page. The users will be asked for their email, username and password or any other combination of credentials in order to \"verify\" their information. Take note that some Apple ID scams can ask for other information as well -- secret questions and answers combinations or birth dates.\\n\\nThis is a recent example of an Apple ID phishing scam which coerces the recipients into thinking that they have received a legitimate Apple security warning. The email message will read that the user\\'s account has had their password changed. Following this action a report has been generated which is attached as a PDF file. This is a classic case of a payload delivery scheme. As soon as the file is opened a virus delivery will be initiated. It can be done either instantly or when the users choose to activate the built-in scripts.\\n\\nWhat\\'s particularly worrying about this particular scenario is that the message will quote time and date of the purposed incident, along with a status ID ticketing which may appear very convincing to many Apple users. The message will feature a bounced sender field coming in from the Apple.com domain. The non-personalized approach may feel similar to the approach Apple has with its own legitimate message notifications.\\n\\nA distinct phishing email message that an Apple ID user might receive is the fake reminder with the subject line \"Problem your account!\". These messages are being sent by a hacker-controlled email address that identifies itself as \"Apple Info\" and sends out an incorrectly-formatted notification that informs that recipients that they need to sign in to their Apple ID accounts.\\n\\nThe victim users will notice that the body contents of the email messages contains broken text layout -- this is intentionally done in order to emulate an issue that the users may be having with their computer. This is linked to the made-up locked account which can additionally entice the targets. The warning signs that this is a fake message are the fake subject line -- the number quoted in the end does not represent any ID or another form of personalized greeting to the victim. The body layout and text contents from Apple will never be styled in this way and the sender\\'s email address will be from the company\\'s domain name. Additionally the \"Sign In Your Apple ID\" will lead to a fake login page -- the URL is traced to a domain not owned by the company.\\n\\nIf you want to remove the Apple ID Phishing Scam from your computer, we strongly suggest that you follow the removal instructions posted underneath this article. They have been created with the main idea In mind to help you delete this virus either manually or automatically. Be advised that according to experts the best way to try and remove the software that is causing the Apple ID Phishing Scamming pop-ups is to use an advanced anti-malware software. Such program is created with the idea in mind to fully scan your computer and try to eliminate any traces of unwanted programs while protecting your computer against future infections as well.',\n",

       "    'title': 'Apple iPadOS Review',\n",
       "    'body': \"Apple's iOS mobile operating system no longer serves two masters. The company now has two distinct operating systems: iOS for phones and iPadOS for tablets. The move acknowledges an open secret: iPads have long had their own distinct needs and a distinct version of iOS. In iPadOS, new gestures and multitasking features appear, as well as improved Apple Pencil integration, and now -- finally -- robust support for a mouse or trackpad. In Apple's eyes, iPads and iPadOS challenge laptops and desktops as a platform for doing work and making art. The new OS makes great strides in streamlining those workflows on Apple's tablet.\\n\\nThe version of iOS on iPhones and iPads has been different since the beginning, and the two have grown further apart over the years, like estranged siblings. As for exactly how much iPadOS and iOS differ under the hood is not clear, but the outwardly visible differences have multiplied lately. Despite that, the iPadOS initial version number matched that of iOS, at 13, so we're clearly not starting from the ground up.\\n\\nThe divergence between the way iOS works on the iPad versus how it does on the iPhone first became truly noteworthy with iOS 11. That update added a laundry list of new tricks and tools to make the iPad more like macOS than iOS. The update introduced features to the iPad Dock to keep track of apps in use, Slide Over for better multitasking, and sensible drag-and-drop interactions. These new features are especially powerful on the iPad Pro, with its enormous screen, particularly when paired with the exquisitely accurate Apple Pencil. The move toward laptop functionality is ironic, since Apple has long taken the stance that touch screens don't work on laptops, yet iPadOS delivers what is essentially a touch-screen laptop.\\n\\nApple wants us to see the iPad as about making things as much as consuming things. The iPhone, meanwhile, is very much about consumption. In addition to its communication functions, you can use it to watch movies, listen to music or podcasts, and play games. Yes, you can take stunning pictures with the iPhone's camera and enhanced Portrait mode, but Apple wants you to touch up that picture or even paint a portrait on an iPad. Adobe's recent, impressive Fresco app makes a strong case for this, as does its iPad version of Photoshop, though the latter still lacks a great many features found in the desktop version.\\n\\nThat's not to say that you can't do the communication things on an iPad -- far from it. Just as on an iPhone, you can use Facetime and Messenger, and, of course, email and social media. Apple updates Messenger in iPadOS just as on iOS, so with version 13.4, you get the same nine new Memoji stickers (including Party Face!). The update also spruces up the Mail app with always-visible message controls and simpler icons.\\n\\nThe formal split with iOS seems to have given Apple more leeway to experiment with iPadOS. For instance, iPadOS sees the first major design change to Apple's mobile home screen since its inception, and a totally new set of gesture interactions. These changes make sense for the larger screen of the iPad, but not for the smaller iPhone. iOS 13 has plenty of new tricks, along with a new Dark Mode, but iPadOS seems far more radical and innovative. One of our biggest first impressions of iPadOS is that it makes iOS look boring.\\n\\nFirst, you need to acquire an iPad or iPad Pro, for which you can now pay up to $1,699 without the Smart Keyboard ($199) or Apple Pencil ($129). That adds up to more than most ultraportable laptops cost. The OS runs on iPad Air 2 and later, iPad 5th generation and later, iPad Mini 4 and later, and iPad Pro. Once you have one of these iPad models, switching to iPadOS is painless. You simply update the OS as you always have, from Settings > General > Software Update.\\n\\nNote that you may have to do this multiple times, because since its release there have been a remarkable number of interim updates just for the first major version: We've had a whopping nine updates since the initial release. With all the interim fix updates, it may be a good idea to hold off on updating to 13.4, a fairly major release; we did experience some buggy behavior. You can now set automatic update downloading, though you still need to accept the license terms and make sure the device is plugged into a charger and connected to Wi-Fi overnight.\\n\\niOS is great, but its basic design remains largely unchanged since the launch of the first iPhone. iPhone app icons are stuck to a grid, which stretches page after page into the distance. iOS 13 follows suit, but it does introduce Dark Mode -- which we discuss below. iPadOS, however, adds wholly new features.\\n\\nInstead of giving us the standard grid of app icons, Apple tightens things up. You can now fit more apps across the screen than before. It's a subtle tweak, but it's enough to make us wish Apple would explore more new ways to interact with your apps. On Android and Windows in tablet mode, your home screen (or screens, plural, for Android) shows only the app icons or tiles you place there, while getting to the full list takes another tap or gesture. Another boon of iPadOS is that it lets you choose larger icons, which makes sense for the huge iPad Pro screen, or smaller ones to squeeze more icons onto a smaller screen.\\n\\nTo Apple's credit, iPadOS lets you pin widgets -- something not possible on the iPhone. Instead of relegating widgets to their own hidden panel, you can now swipe them into view on your Home Screen and keep them in view in Today View. If you've wanted the weather forecast, news headlines, or similar always on the home screen, now you can have that. We had no trouble swiping it into and out of view, and pinning the apps was a breeze.\\n\\nAndroid has offered a more flexible feature for years, but while Apple's approach is late, it's also more streamlined. These widgets are all very consistently designed, unlike Android's developer-driven hodgepodge that, frankly, has fallen out of fashion. This is just one change for Apple, but anything that affects the home screen feels titanic. Hopefully, this step will lead to a greater willingness to explore how people interact with their iDevices.\\n\\nDespite our grumpiness about Apple's ossifying design, we cannot stress enough how good iPadOS feels. That shouldn't be too surprising, since it's built on the foundation of iOS, which has been polished to a blinding shine. On our iPad, apps leap open, and Slide Over windows seamlessly snap to the edge or melt into Split View. Everything moves with smooth fluidity. Whatever complaints you might have about Apple and its products, the quality of the iPadOS and iOS experience is undeniable. Apple's mobile operating systems look and feel spectacular.\\n\\nApple really wants you to look at an iPad as a replacement for a laptop, or even a dedicated art-making machine, and to that end iPadOS is packed with workflow improvements. Split View and Slide Over, introduced in iOS 11, already offered ways to work in two apps at once, and iPadOS expands on the idea. You can now pull a Slide Over app up to see all your running Slide Over apps and move quickly between them. It's a great experience, although we still accidentally split the screen when we mean to slide over -- mastering new gestures can take even PCMag staffers some time.\\n\\niPadOS jostles a core concept of iOS by allowing you to open more than one instance of an app. You can now have an app running, and then Slide Over the same app. You can even have multiple instances of the same app in Slide Over and two in Split View. Tap on the app's icon in the Dock and App Expose reveals all the windows for a given app. Apple says that this works with both first- and third-party apps, but we did find at least one app that didn't cooperate with Split View (the Airbnb app).\\n\\nWe also note that the dock icon doesn't indicate multiple app instances if they're running; perhaps the developers could add some mark to the icon (like message count numbers in the Mail icon) to remedy that. Having multiple windows, however, is useful for things like moving files around or writing an email response while looking at another email.\\n\\nAll these interactions look great, but we wonder whether the average iPad owner will take advantage of them. We don't know, for instance, if people really understand the difference between Slide Over and Split View. For people who don't, these improvements may not matter much. We're also not convinced that these offer a better experience than simply having multiple, individual windows on a screen as you would with a desktop operating system.\\n\\nIt feels more like a loose translation of a workflow in the language of iOS, rather than a true innovation. Indeed, a combination of overlapping Side by Side and Slide Over panels can become counterproductive, as you can see below, where the weather sidebar makes the split window below quite useless. What's more, even tapping on the underlying window doesn't reveal it, as happens on any desktop OS.\\n\\nOther usability tweaks abound in iPadOS, with particular emphasis on the use of three fingers simultaneously. A three-finger swipe now undoes your last edit, doing away with the shake-to-undo that has persisted since the very beginning of iOS. Three-finger pinching a section of text copies it, and doing the action twice cuts it. Inverting the action -- a three-finger spread -- pastes the text. iPadOS helpfully displays a little notice at the top of the screen to let you know you've copied or cut the text successfully.\\n\\niPadOS (and the latest iOS version) also does away with the magnifier that appears when you highlight text or move the cursor, a feature we rather liked. Now, you tap and hold on the cursor, drag your finger down a little, and move it to where you want it. As you move your digit, the vertical-line cursor gets longer and hovers above your finger while you move through the text. You can also select text by tapping and holding on a word and then dragging to include all the text you want to select.\\n\\nThese new text interactions make sense, and we had little trouble picking them up after a few minutes. We still have trouble putting down three fingers and often find that we miss the mark when trying to highlight text. We think it's telling that the usually very scripted Apple had a hard time showing these off on stage at WWDC 2019. Clearly, these will take some getting used to.\\n\\nOther tweaks draw heavily from the desktop experience. When scrolling through a document, simply grab the scroll indicator and move it to exactly where you'd like it. The Files app now displays file metadata and includes quick actions -- such as rotating an image -- and a column view -- just like in macOS.\\n\\nThe revamped Files app in iPadOS also now supports flash drives. We got this to work with an Adata external SSD formatted with the exFAT file system. You can also connect a camera to your iPad to import photos directly from the source. We successfully did so in the Photos app from a Sony DSC-RX100 III shooting in JPG-plus-ARW file formats. Files also now lets you share folders via iCloud; you can enforce permissions or allowing access to anyone with the link.\\n\\nIn case you had any illusions about Apple's desktop ambitions for the iPad, Safari in iPadOS prevents websites from serving you the mobile version of a site. Apple says that the browser will provide a specially resized version of the desktop site, which makes using web interfaces like blogging platforms much easier on the iPad.\\n\\niPadOS includes QuickPath, Apple's take on Swype-style typing, in which you drag your finger from letter to letter (also now in iOS). Another iPad trick is pinching the on-screen keyboard, which shrinks it down and turns it into a floating window that can be repositioned around the screen. This looks significantly less stupid than the massive on-screen keyboard for iPad that dominates the screen, but it also makes one-fingered text entry possible on the iPad.\\n\\nAfter using the smaller keyboard for a few hours, we find it far more natural than a huge on-screen keyboard. We're also fans of the split keyboard option, which you get by unpinching the standard keyboard; this is perfect when you're holding the iPad with two hands by its side, for thumb typing. Unfortunately, Apple decided not to include this capability in newer iPad Pros, whose huge screens would seem to make it even more essential, unless the user only uses the device as a laptop.\\n\\nWith the 13.4 version update, Apple finally quelled one of the biggest complaints about using an iPad for real work -- mouse and trackpad support. Note that this new support is only in iPadOS -- not iOS. It also differs from the limited mouse support previously provided for accessibility (see the Accessibility section below).\\n\\nYou can now pair a mouse or trackpad in the same Bluetooth section of settings just as you would with a keyboard or wireless speaker. The cursor position shows as a translucent dot, and acts as your finger would on the touch screen, letting you press buttons and drag screen items up and down, left and right. You can also invoke iPad's search panel and scroll through homepage icons and web pages.\\n\\nFor things like context menus and selection you use a double tap on the mouse button. Selecting text works beautifully, just as it would on a desktop, with the exception of selecting multiple entries in the Files app, which you can only do after tapping the Select option. On desktop operating systems, the extra tap isn't required. We could move most slider controls, but (oddly) not those in the Photos app to adjust brightness and the like.\\n\\nA Settings page lets you set the tracking speed, scrolling direction, and secondary click options. With very few quibbles, mouse implementation for iPad is very satisfying. Not to be forgotten is new keyboard support, too, for Apple's Magic Keyboard, which lets you control the iPad without ever touching the screen -- just like a laptop.\\n\\nApple has continued to tweak the Apple Pencil. The company says that it has reduced latency with the Apple Pencil from 20ms to 9ms, making it the most responsive stylus on the market. Latency is a factor of the pen hardware, the software being used, the tablet hardware, and the operating system, so your mileage may vary. Suffice it to say that no vendor has claimed a latency lower than 9ms.\\n\\nThere's also a tool palette for the Pencil that can be moved around and anchored on the screen. Apple has even included a gesture specific to the Apple Pencil: Drag from the corner, and the view shifts to an editable screenshot. iPadOS also supports a full-page screenshot option, which captures the full length of a document or website, not just what's on the screen.\\n\\nWe miss two features of the Microsoft Surface Pen, however: One is the button, which adds contextual functions, and secondly the easy ability to enter text in a writing box in an on-screen keyboard digital-inking mode. Yes, there are some third-party iPad apps that can convert your scrawl into text with varying success, but having the capability built into the OS as a keyboard option is preferable, since it works anywhere, even for something like writing an email.\\n\\nApple is looking to turn your iPad into a hardware peripheral in its own right. The Sidecar feature lets you use an iPad as a second monitor for your macOS device. Alternatively, you can use your iPad as a dedicated drawing tablet, connected to your macOS desktop computer. That's sure to be a boon to artists already familiar with the iPad and Apple Pencil, who are tempted by all-in-one drawing tablets with displays, such as the Wacom Cintiq 16.\\n\\nSidecar is not just for drawing: We set it up on our iPad with Final Cut Pro running on a powerful iMac, though the process involved several failed attempts, with Device Timed Out messages and Miscellaneous Error messages. Not only does Sidecar add a display for the timeline, preview, or source panel, but it also adds a Touch Bar along the top. Unfortunately, the meat of the display on the iPad is just that -- a display, with no touch interaction possible.\\n\\nTwo Accessibility features are also worth highlighting: The first, Voice Control, lets you control your iPad with your voice, bringing a feature found in desktops (with the exception of Chromebooks) to mobile devices. You can open apps just by speaking a command and invoke a numbered grid or numbered tap-able options, to interact with on-screen elements. Apple showed a video at WWDC of a wheelchair user planning a trip through voice control, and we were happy to find that our experience matched the presentation. It's just so easy.\\n\\nThe second, Bluetooth Pointing Device support, is mouse support for accessibility. This doesn't quite work like the mouse on your desktop or like the new general Bluetooth mouse and trackpad support discussed above. As with that, a circular cursor speeds across the screen in response to your movements, and the on-screen AssistiveTouch button takes the place of tapping the Home button.\\n\\nYou can use your mouse with the QuickPath swipe keyboard, which is an unusual experience. This is an Accessibility feature, made for people with specific needs, and Apple has designed it as such. Speaking of keyboards, Apple missed an opportunity to add iPad-specific keys to the companion Smart Keyboards it sells for the iPad. Both Chromebooks and Microsoft Surface keyboards have OS-specific keys, but the iPad keyboard is nearly identical to the Mac keyboard. Even a key for the Home screen or the Today View would have been welcome.\\n\\nWhile iPadOS is now a distinct product in the eyes of Apple, all the features of iOS 13.4 are also in iPadOS. That means Dark Mode, which replaces most windows with a warm, dark slate color scheme, is now on your iPad. There are even dual-mode desktop backgrounds, similar to the night and day themes in macOS Catalina. The News, Calendar, Notes, and especially Reminders apps also get the same updates. Photos, too, gets a major overhaul, resulting in a more interesting experience when browsing through your images.\\n\\nTaking photos with your iPad is a bit of a faux pas but if you do so, you'll have access to Apple's improved controls for Portrait-mode photos. Apple has also tweaked its photo editor, making it simpler to adjust your photos to perfection, and video-editing gets numerous enhancements, including filters.\\n\\nApple has improved privacy features across the operating system. A new option requires apps to request approval every time they request location information. The system now pops up notifications about apps that have been using your location, asking whether you want them to continue doing so and optionally showing maps of where the requests occurred.\\n\\nApple is introducing its own sign-in option for websites and apps, going by the imaginative name, Sign in with Apple. This is intended to be more privacy-conscious than similar features offered by Google or Facebook. Apple will even generate a bogus email for each account, giving you more control over who has your information. The service is still no where near as ubiquitous as those from the two internet giants, however.\\n\\nWhen reviewing iOS, we find it useful to compare it with other operating systems from other tech giants. In addition to fanning the flames for clicks, these comparisons illustrate how smart, well-funded companies tackle the same problems. The comparisons seem a bit odd for iPadOS, however.\\n\\nDespite some efforts towards split screens and multitasking improvements, Android tablets never took off the way iPads have. Android can scale from phones to TVs to foldables, but it's still a mobile OS first, intended to live in your pocket and be used with one hand. Android tablets also suffer from the same fragmentation you find among the phones. At the time of this writing, we couldn't find a single Android tablet that ships with the current version 10 of the OS and it's telling that Google no longer sells a tablet running its mobile OS. Apps work or don't work based on the tablet's OS version and hardware, both of which vary far more than with iPads. With any recent iPad, you can rest assured that its OS is up to date and all apps in the store will work on it. And starting with version 13.4 developers a single app purchase can work across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.\\n\\nAnother alternative is Chrome OS. It's lightweight, like a mobile OS, but uses the visual language of a desktop OS. It does support Android mobile apps to varying degrees, alongside desktop-style web browser-based apps. Despite some attempts at grooving ChromeOS into the touch tablet space, the results have been lackluster, and even Google itself is exiting the Chrome OS tablet business.\\n\\nMicrosoft has embraced the tablet form factor since 2012 with its line of Surface devices that have redefined Windows as an operating system that can accommodate both form factors well. Like iPadOS, Windows on Surface devices use touch as the primary interface, and Microsoft also has its own hardware smart stylus: the Surface Pen. The diminutive (and affordable) Microsoft Surface Go ships with Windows 10 S, a lightweight version of the operating system that, like iPadOS, restricts you to apps from the officially sanctioned app store. Unlike iPadOS, Windows 10 S can be upgraded to Windows 10 Home -- a full-fledged desktop version of Windows 10.\\n\\nEven in that context, iPadOS still feels unique. Chrome OS and Windows 10 take established desktop computer workflows and try to translate them to a touch interface, while iPadOS moves in the opposite direction, trying to add desktop workflows to an existing touch experience. This difference in approach is most noticeable when you try to multitask. Chrome OS and Windows 10 both allow floating windows that you can easily move between. iPadOS makes up ground with an improved Dock, Split View, Slide Over, and the new multi-window app experience, but it's unclear whether iPadOS can fully shake the single-window app paradigm established with iOS. These features display all of Apple's trademark polish, but they feel weirdly kludgy, because users have ingrained ideas about how they're supposed to work on a desktop.\\n\\nPCMag has written extensively about using an iPad as a laptop replacement, which would be the highest measure of the platform's utility for any kind of work. We've always felt that the iPad is an excellent platform but that even the high-end iPad Pro came up short as a challenger to desktops and laptops. It's this issue that iPadOS seems to address directly, but it doesn't fully succeed. If you're already using your iPad heavily for work and creative activities, iPadOS will probably make that experience easier and open new avenues to do more things. If, however, you feel that a traditional desktop experience is what you need, then we don't think iPadOS is going to bridge that gap just yet.\\n\\nWith iPadOS, Apple explores a melding of mobile and desktop experiences. With mixed success, it translates the desktop experiences of multitasking and multi-windowed work with the glossy sheen of the iOS mobile, touch experience. New mouse/trackpad support and improvements to Apple Pencil capability make iPad a more a tempting enough proposition, however. iPadOS lifts some of the restrictions of iOS in order to make work easier, letting you pin widgets and access files on flash drives or cameras. Sidecar features further the connection between macOS and iPadOS, turning your iPad into a drawing tablet or second monitor.\\n\\nDespite all those changes, iPadOS is still very much grounded in the legacy and language of iOS. Some of Apple's new tricks feel overly complicated compared with the established workflows found on desktop computers. If you've been frustrated with working on an iPad running iOS, iPadOS is not going to change your mind. If, however, you've already found iOS to be fertile ground for growing your creativity and productivity, the upgrade to iPadOS is like a brisk rain shower and a full day's sun.\",\n",

       "    'title': \"Looking back at 10 years of the iPad, Apple's revolutionary tablet - General Discussion Discussions on AppleInsider Forums\",\n",
       "    'body': 'On April 3, 2010, the iPad wasn\\'t really an iPhone and not quite a Mac. The latest iPads blend the best of both worlds -- and that\\'s been an evolution a decade in the making.\\n\\nWith trackpad support, revamped file systems, and no shortage of computing power, the latest iPad Pro lineup are serious competitors in usability for nearly every task to any hybrid or touchscreen notebooks out there. It hasn\\'t always been that way, though.\\n\\nLong before the first iPhone, Apple was experimenting with tablet-like form factors and devices like the Newton MessagePad PDAs, or prototype hardware such as the PenLite (pictured above), a tablet device based on PowerBook.\\n\\nNeither of those devices turned into the iPad, or really found much commercial success. Apple continued to work on the concept, eventually crafting a new multitouch tablet prototype in 2004. Although originally slated to launch before the first iPhone, Apple\\'s leadership eventually decided that the smartphone was more important.\\n\\nThe original iPhone debuted in 2007. Almost immediately after its release, rumors started circulating that Apple had some type of tablet in the works, and AppleInsider was one of the first venues to talk about it. Just three years filled with furious speculation later, late Apple CEO and cofounder Steve Jobs unveiled the very first iPad on Jan. 27, 2010 at the Yerba Buena Center in San Francisco.\\n\\nApple\\'s original iPad, announced in January 2010, landed in the public\\'s hands on April 3. That first version featured a 9.7-inch display, an Apple A4 processor and up to 10 hours of battery life. It started at $499, with storage options topping out at 64GB, and interestingly, featured squared-off edges similar to today\\'s iPad Pro.\\n\\nBut while it may seem fairly archaic by today\\'s standards -- the device didn\\'t even have a camera -- the original iPad heralded the age of the tablet for the average consumer after a decade of half-baked ideas on the Windows side. Apple sold about 300,000 at launch, and by May 3, that number reached a million. Through the end of 2010, iPads were outpacing Mac sales on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\\n\\nReleased about a year after the original iPad, the iPad 2 was certainly a refinement of Apple\\'s tablet ambitions. It was lighter, thinner, packed a dual-core A5 chip, and introduced support for Smart Covers. Importantly, it was also the first tablet to sport a rear- and front-facing camera.\\n\\nIt\\'s likely the device to help materialize what a tablet was from Apple\\'s perspective. It became a cornerstone in Apple\\'s line, eventually supported by six different versions of iOS, and it was really the first iPad to be specifically marketed for the education sector.\\n\\nThe incrementally updated iPad 3 came in 2012, sporting largely the same design as its predecessor. Its primary upgrade was a Retina display that offered 4 times the pixel count of the iPad 2. It also featured an improved 5MP camera, an A5X chipset and localized LTE support\\n\\nThings started changing for Apple\\'s tablet lineup later in 2012. Several months after the debut of the third-generation iPad, Apple released a fourth generation that sported an A6X chip, FaceTime HD and a Lightning port -- becoming the first iPad to ditch the 30-pin connector.\\n\\nThat was an extremely quick refresh by any standard, and many reviewers found it difficult to recommend the fourth-generation iPad for consumers who had just bought the earlier iPad months before. Apple eventually relaunched the iPad 4 in 2014, after temporarily discontinuing it.\\n\\nAlongside \"the new iPad,\" Apple also launched the iPad mini, a tablet featuring similar specifications to the iPad 2 but in a smaller 7.9-inch footprint. While initially launched to fend off the likes of Amazon Kindles and Google Nexus tablets, it also marked the first time Apple really diversified the iPad lineup.\\n\\nApple redesigned the iPad again in 2013 with the iPad Air, the first tablet sold under that moniker. It featured upgraded cameras, slimmer bezels, and an A7 processor combined with an M7 motion co-processor. It was also, per its name, much thinner and lighter than the iPad 2.\\n\\nThe Cupertino company also released a new iPad mini at the same time, though it was a muted update with the only major feature being a Retina display.\\n\\nA year later, in 2014, Apple released the iPad Air 2 and the iPad mini 3. Both tablets featured Touch ID for the first time, and the Air 2 was updated to a triple-core A8X CPU and 2GB of RAM. By then, the iPad\\'s popularity was beginning to wane in the face of larger handsets like the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.\\n\\nIf you were to try and trace the start of Apple\\'s current tablet strategy, 2015 would be a good place to start. In an effort to revitalize the iPad, Apple released the very first iPad Pro in September 2015.\\n\\nIt was a 12.9-inch tablet with an A9X processor, 4GB of RAM and the very first Smart Connector port, allowing users to connect the tablet to the Smart Keyboard without Bluetooth. Alongside the new Pro device, Apple also unveiled the first Apple Pencil, an advanced stylus with low latency, angle detection and pressure sensitivity.\\n\\nApple also released an iPad mini 4 at the same time. Featuring an A8 processor and 2GB of RAM, the device would become the last iteration of Apple\\'s mini-tablets for some time.\\n\\nA smaller iPad Pro, first equipped with a 9.7-inch display, was later released in March 2016. While essentially a smaller version of the 12.9-inch model, it included some unique features and additions, including True Tone display technology and a rose gold color option.\\n\\nThis was also the time that Apple started differentiating iOS for iPad from iOS for iPhone. iOS 9 featured new multitasking features like Split View, Slide Over and Picture in Picture, hinting at what was to come.\\n\\nApple quietly announced the fifth-generation iPad in March 2017, dropping the Air moniker for a time. But despite the change in name, the entry-level iPad still had the same design -- though it was a little thicker. It did feature a price drop and upgraded internals, however.\\n\\nThere were also two new iPad Pro models in 2017. The most significant update was the smaller of the two, which was bumped up to a 10.5-inch display with 40% slimmer bezels and a 120Hz display refresh rate.\\n\\nThe 10.5-inch iPad Pro featured 30% faster performance and 40% better graphics than its predecessor, thanks to a new A10X and M10 co-processor. The 12.9-inch featured similar upgrades, but its footprint remained the same as its predecessor.\\n\\nApple took another shot at the iPad Pro in 2018, and it turned out to be a major upgrade. The now-11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro received the \"iPhone X\" treatment with uniform and ultra-slim bezels. They also nixed the Home button in favor of Face ID and gesture-based controls.\\n\\nThe major overhaul also saw the Lightning connector replaced with a USB-C port, as well as the introduction of a new generation of Apple Pencil which attached to an iPad Pro and charged magnetically. Internally, the devices feature an A12 Bionic chipset, a new Liquid Retina display, upgraded cameras and storage capacities up to 1TB for the first time.\\n\\nThe 2018 base iPad, by comparison, was an incremental upgrade. It sported essentially the same design that we\\'ve seen since the iPad Air 2. While it missed out on most modern iPad Pro features, it remained significantly cheaper than most Apple tablets and featured an upgraded A10 chip and Apple Pencil support.\\n\\nIn 2019, we saw one of the largest revamps of the broader iPad stable to date. Apple released a total of three new iPads across the lineup: a new base model iPad, an iPad mini and the first iPad Air since 2014.\\n\\nThe iPad Air, the third-generation, was essentially a 10.5-inch iPad Pro successor without Touch ID or USB-C. With a middle-ground price point, the iPad Air features serious power for the money with support for the first-generation Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard.\\n\\nApple\\'s new iPad mini, unofficially the iPad mini 5, is also essentially an iPad Pro in a different form factor. It featured the same 7.9-inch display and home button of the last iPad mini, but packs Apple\\'s latest silicon and other internal upgrades under the hood.\\n\\nApple also released a new entry-level iPad with a 10.2-inch display, its most affordable tablet by far. Around this time, Apple also split off its tablet operating system into iPadOS, which incorporated some exclusive multitasking features separate from iOS, like the ability to open multiple windows of the same app or better text editing capabilities.\\n\\nWhile the undercurrents have been there for at least a couple of years, 2020 really marks the first time that the iPad became something more akin to a computer than a tablet.\\n\\nThe 2020 iPad Pro models remained relatively unchanged from their 2018 predecessors, sporting the same general design and specifications. The addition of a LiDAR sensor, a new A12Z Bionic chipset and an 8-core GPU are some of the major upgrades.\\n\\nBut something else happened in 2020 that really changed things up for Apple\\'s tablets: the introduction of full trackpad and mouse support. Alongside a new Smart Keyboard with Trackpad accessory, Apple introduced full support for pointing devices in iPadOS 13.4.\\n\\nThat marks a departure from Apple\\'s previous strategy. While iOS and iPadOS 13 featured mouse support, it was buried in Accessibility. Now, it\\'s front and center. Apple even expanded that support to non-Pro tablets, and Logitech debuted trackpad options for the entry-level iPad and iPad Air.\\n\\nAnd, more than anything else, that really suggests that Apple views the iPad Pro lineup as a serious competitor to actual laptops and two-in-one hybrids. While some hurdles remain, such as a closed-off filesystem, Apple\\'s tablets are more like a PC than they\\'ve ever been before.\\n\\nThe latest iPad Pro models, and iPadOS, paint a clear direction for Apple\\'s tablets. They\\'re not designed to replace the Mac, but offer an alternative computer experience. And while Apple doesn\\'t want the iPad to cannibalize sales of its MacBooks, it undoubtedly wants Windows hybrid owners to ditch their notebooks for iPad Pros.\\n\\nThat\\'s significant because the iPad has been in the midst of an identity crisis, and back in 2018, some analysts thought of Apple\\'s tablet as a dying product. But additions like cross-platform apps, deeper multitasking, better filesystem access and trackpad support have allowed iPadOS to find its footing.\\n\\nMore computer-like improvements are coming. Some rumors indicate that Apple will allow users to choose third-party apps as their defaults in iOS 14, expected later this year. That\\'s been a feature of desktop operating systems like macOS. Amid rumors of ARM Macs, it\\'s likely that work on cross-platform apps is only going to quicken.\\n\\nAs far as where the hardware goes from here, Apple is rumored to release 5G-compatible iPads sometime in 2020, and there\\'s little doubt that the iPad is still a central part of Apple\\'s broader augmented reality strategy.\\n\\nIn other words, the current iPad is a device that\\'s a decade in the making. And by the looks of it, it\\'s not going anywhere in the next one.',\n",

       "    'body': \"As the tech industry braces for an economic downturn caused by the global pandemic, its biggest companies, which sit on billions of dollars of cash reserves, are perhaps best positioned. But Apple, one of the world's most valuable companies, faces a unique set of challenges because of its secretive culture, focus on hardware and dependence on Chinese manufacturing, according to interviews The Information conducted in recent days with a dozen current and former employees, as well as others who work closely with the company.\\n\\nThe Takeaway\\n\\n* Dependence on face-to-face meetings makes remote work difficult for some at Apple\\n\\n* Most hardware prototyping has stopped as work must be in secure labs\\n\\n* With travel to China banned, decision-making for parts manufacturing has slowed\\n\\nAmong Silicon Valley's giants, Apple is especially reliant on face-to-face meetings. It encourages employees to use the company's own communications and file-sharing services for security and reliability reasons, though it has begun allowing them to use some third-party tools like Slack and Box. Most employees aren't accustomed to holding meetings with colleagues via videoconference and some have found it difficult to use Apple's own offerings such as FaceTime, iCloud and iMessage, as they weren't designed for enterprise users, according to current and former employees.\\n\\nAt the same time, Apple's focus on hardware requires more physical interaction -- employees need to touch and view parts in person -- than the software development that accounts for much of the activity of other big tech companies (The Information has also reported on challenges facing Amazon's hardware teams). And because Apple's claim to fame is making software that works well with its hardware, its software engineers also need access to unreleased products. Apple employees say figuring out how to design and test hardware products remotely is an even bigger obstacle for the company than enforcing the rules of its secretive culture while staffers work from home.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Apple has been forced to find creative ways to work with manufacturers in China without visiting their factories, many of which were shut down for weeks after the coronavirus began spreading in that country. While companies like Google and Facebook are less reliant on hardware sales, they are paramount for Apple, which needs employees on the ground in China to sign off on the look and feel of its devices at key stages in the manufacturing process.\\n\\nMany of those factories have since reopened as the outbreak has slowed in China while gaining speed overseas. It might be a while, though, before Apple employees can return to China. Last week, the Chinese government announced it would ban all foreign visitors from entering mainland China and restrict most flights in and out of the country to one weekly per airline until further notice. Beijing's directive came almost two months after Apple banned travel to China for its employees during the initial outbreak of Covid-19.\\n\\nAn Apple spokesperson declined to comment for this story.\\n\\nCorporate Culture\\n\\nApple CEO Tim Cook began encouraging employees to work remotely one week before San Francisco issued a stay-at-home order on March 16, employees said. In the weeks since, some teams at Apple have found it harder to adjust to the new arrangements than others, especially those teams who are required to handle prototypes, many of which are locked away in secure labs on Apple's campus in California.\\n\\nEmployees can no longer use Apple's 3-D printers and milling machines, nor can they conduct stress and drop tests of their designs. One employee said prototyping in Cupertino had mostly stopped. At first, Apple didn't have a protocol in place for employees to bring components from future products home with them, but more recently it has established a process for doing so in some instances, two employees said.\\n\\nMany employees aren't used to video chatting with colleagues, current and former employees said. Some are using FaceTime for one-on-one video calls, which they said aren't ideal because they can't easily share their computer screens with their colleagues through the app. Others are using Cisco Systems' WebEx software, which Apple has approved for work.\\n\\nWhile employees have long used WebEx for internal conference calls, they rarely turned on the video feature. Some former employees said the WebEx software on Macs was glitchy and its user interface wasn't intuitive. Since employees have begun working from home, some Apple supervisors have asked them to begin turning on video during their meetings because of the team's need for visuals, one employee said.\\n\\nCurrent and former employees say Apple has long been reluctant to use third-party software when an Apple alternative exists. For example, Apple only approved the use of Slack for office messaging last fall, and teams have been adopting it at their own pace, according to two employees.\\n\\nSome Apple employees say they have largely been able to replicate what they can do in the office at home: for instance, accessing confidential documents via corporate virtual private networks or accessing desktops remotely to work on computer-aided designs. One employee said the biggest struggle was dealing with a slow home internet connection; that person is one of four roommates working remotely from an apartment, two of them Apple employees.\\n\\nAnother employee said Apple has sent regular updates advising them how to work comfortably at home, emphasizing proper ergonomics such as the best angles for looking at screens and encouraging them to stay healthy and fit by doing regular stretching. Apple employees have been told they can expense office supplies and bring items home from headquarters to make their home workspaces more comfortable, including their Vitra Pacific office chairs, which retail for more than $1,000 each, two employees said.\\n\\nOne employee said he continues to follow Apple's security protocols at home, such as making sure others can't see his screen. However, he said he doubted his wife and small children cared enough about his work for this to matter.\\n\\nChina Challenge\\n\\nPrior to the Covid-19 outbreak in January, Apple sent dozens of employees to China each day to oversee the manufacturing of its products, former employees say. Last year, United Airlines boasted that Apple was its largest global account, spending $150 million on flights each year, with Shanghai and Hong Kong the top two destinations, according to a banner intended to be seen only by United employees, a photo of which was widely circulated online. Apple was responsible for 50 business class seats a day to Shanghai, the banner said.\\n\\nBut in late January, Cook restricted employee travel to China. For many Apple employees, traveling to its overseas factories, particularly those in China, is a critical aspect of the job. In the factories, Apple employees are able to help implement processes, quickly identify manufacturing defects and communicate status updates back to headquarters. One former employee said that even though Apple's suppliers also provide status reports, a visiting Apple employee typically verified those reports prior to the coronavirus travel restrictions.\\n\\nBefore the pandemic, Apple routinely sent employees to learn about manufacturing processes in China and to tour Chinese factories involved in their projects. One executive at an Apple supplier said it isn't unusual for Apple product design and manufacturing engineers to visit his factory in Shenzhen every three or four months during normal times.\\n\\nWith the worst of the outbreak over in China, employees say Apple is relying more heavily on its China-based workers to pick up the slack, many of whom are used to playing supporting roles for their counterparts in Cupertino.\\n\\nOne employee said if a hardware component breaks on the factory line, the company is asking manufacturers to send photos to engineers in the U.S. to assess the problem, since there are often no Apple staff on-site to troubleshoot the issue. The employee described the photos as grainy, adding that they were never quite as clear as engineers needed them to be.\\n\\nOne factor complicating the taking of these photos is that Apple has long had strict rules that prevent the bringing of unauthorized devices onto factory floors, according to former employees and documents reviewed by The Information. Only authorized employees are allowed to handle cameras, which must be approved, logged and accounted for at the end of each shift.\\n\\nThe cameras can't have wireless functionality and must have their removable storage sealed with tamper-proof and serialized stickers. Images taken from these devices can only be uploaded via designated computers and by approved personnel. Each image also must be logged and credited to the person who took the photo.\\n\\nSince the coronavirus now prevents Apple employees from traveling to factories, some employees say product teams are pushing to enable more factory workers to take and share photos. However, Apple managers are concerned this could lead to product leaks.\\n\\nOne employee said it can sometimes take 24 hours of back-and-forth emails for teams in California to receive the photos they need for assessments that typically would only take seconds in person. To help expedite that process, some teams in the Bay Area have added a night shift so at least one member can respond to suppliers in China during Asia's work hours. Even still, the employee said the inability to hold a component in hand makes troubleshooting problems nearly impossible.\\n\\nAlthough the Covid-19 outbreak has created roadblocks for Apple, one executive at an Apple supplier said he sees no signs that the company is slowing down. Apple has continued to place a steady stream of orders for components and recently increased orders for parts related to the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max. Apple's procurement managers, meanwhile, continue to hound his company to turn in cost breakdowns for new projects as quickly as possible.\\n\\nOne employee said he hopes the pandemic and the resulting creation of new work systems will convince Apple to be more flexible about allowing employees to work from home one or two days a week once the crisis abates. The employee said that prior to the outbreak, many of his colleagues were clamoring to be allowed to do just that. They hope that the current situation will convince Apple management that workers can be as productive from home as they are in the office.\",\n",

       "    'title': 'Best Apple TV apps and games: 30 must-download apps on Apple TV and Apple TV 4K',\n",
       "    'body': 'If you\\'re all-in on Apple\\'s ecosystem of hardware and software, the Apple TV HD and Apple TV 4K are pretty much must-own streaming devices. The way they tie into the App Store is flawless and if you find yourself wanting to use AirPlay over Chromecast, they\\'re basically the only streaming devices on the market that are going to deliver for you.\\n\\nBut the Apple TV and Apple TV 4K\\'s biggest advantage is the App Store.\\n\\nWith thousands of apps and games to pick from the App Store is a labyrinth of content - some of which is way better than others. While Apple does a pretty good job sussing out the good from the bad, finding some of the less popular apps can be a challenge. That\\'s why we\\'re here to help.\\n\\nWe\\'ve scoured the App Store for the best Apple TV apps and games - from household streaming staples like Netflix and Disney Plus to the more obscure games and apps that are hidden off the beaten path - we\\'ve found 30 games and apps you absolutely need.\\n\\nDoes it require a subscription? Sort of...\\n\\nThe best place to start your content search on Apple TV is... well, the Apple TV app. Here you\\'ll find content recommendations from a number of service providers - including Amazon Prime Video, HBO and others that each have their own individual apps that we\\'ll cover below - as well as Apple\\'s own service, Apple TV Plus. Speaking of, we recommend at least demoing the service for a week to binge-watch The Morning Show, See and one of our personal favorites, Mythic Quest: Raven\\'s Banquet.\\n\\nDoes it require a subscription? Yes\\n\\nOf course, if you\\'re looking for some new music to relax with, your best bet is going to be the Apple Music app that comes pre-installed on both the Apple TV and Apple TV 4K. No, unfortunately this one isn\\'t free either, but like Apple TV Plus it comes with a pretty substantial free trial - three months in this case. Why you\\'ll fall in love with it is the incredibly well-curated playlist selection, massive music library and some neat extra features like Beats1 Radio.\\n\\nDoes it require a subscription? Yes\\n\\nOne of the last essential apps from Apple worth taking a look at as soon as you boot up the Apple TV is Apple Arcade - which is both the name of the app and the name of Apple\\'s all-you-can-play game service that has over 100 titles, all of which can be downloaded simultaneously. Here\\'s the good news and the bad news. The bad news is that, again, it\\'s not free - but the good news is that there\\'s a free trial and the subscription is good for your entire family and will work on any of your iOS devices, iPad and iPhone included.\\n\\nDoes it require a subscription? No\\n\\nTired of subscriptions at this point? We don\\'t blame you. To mix things up, make sure you download YouTube - probably the most content-rich app on the entire planet. For a new generation of viewers, YouTube has pretty much replaced traditional TV programming - but a big screen still makes clips and shows a better experience. The YouTube app carries over your personal profile from other devices, so it\\'s easy to kick back and enjoy your favorite Youtubers from the comfort of your couch.\\n\\nDoes it require a subscription? No\\n\\nApple Events might not be up everyone\\'s alley, but if you want to be one of the first to hear about the next Apple TV, iPhone or iPad, it\\'s absolutely essential to have this one downloaded. The exact dates of Apple\\'s WWDC developer event changes every year - but this app will always be the best way to watch it.\\n\\nDoes it require a subscription? Yes\\n\\nIf you\\'re talking about streaming services, you have to talk about Netflix. This may seem like a no-brainer for Netflix subscribers (or anyone who\\'d like a free trial month), but the app is worth singling out because of how well it works with Apple TV\\'s new Siri-powered search. Just say, \"Show me The Walking Dead, season two,\" and you\\'re instantly given the option to watch any season-two episode on Netflix or iTunes. You\\'re still going to need an account subscription to use it, but at least the app is available for free.\\n\\nDoes it require a subscription? Yes\\n\\nNew to Apple TV devices is the Disney Plus app that offers classic Disney animated movies, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and even 20th Century Fox content like The Simpsons. You\\'ve probably heard of it because of its first hit series, The Mandalorian, which is exclusive to Disney Plus, but it has a few other noteworthy shows and movies that you can\\'t find anywhere else. You\\'re still going to need an account subscription to use it, but at least the app is available for free.\\n\\nDoes it require a subscription? Yes\\n\\nHulu is like Netflix\\'s younger cousin. Both services have tons of great content and work as a replacement for pricey cable bills, but Hulu goes one step further by providing a live TV option in addition to its cheaper ad-supported version that costs a few bucks per month. Although the ads are a bit annoying, Hulu\\'s the only place you can watch shows like The Mindy Project, Bob\\'s Burgers, and The Handmaid\\'s Tale, and that alone makes it a pretty tempting choice.\\n\\nDoes it require a subscription? Yes\\n\\nAmazon may not get as much airtime as Netflix for its work in streaming video, but its Amazon Prime Video service does have a number of hits that are worth checking out. Recent years have seen a steady supply of exclusive shows, such as Good Omens, The Man in the High Castle and Vikings, and the service also has an impressive selection of movies available, too. It\\'s definitely worth checking out the catalogue before you subscribe, but if you\\'re already a Prime subscriber the Amazon Prime Video app is a no-brainer.\\n\\nDoes it require a subscription? Yes\\n\\nWe could spend hours highlighting other streaming video apps on Apple TV, but we\\'ll spotlight just one more here, Emmy darling HBO. There are actually two HBO apps: HBO Go, for people who subscribe to the channel through a cable provider, and HBO Now, for those who subscribe directly. Content is the same for both, and either option includes hits like Game of Thrones, Watchmen, Westworld and a whole lot more.\\n\\nDoes it require a subscription? Sort of...\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking to add some sports content to your Apple TV and Apple TV 4K, you should probably start first with the ESPN app. While the Apple TV version of the app itself isn\\'t as intuitive as the mobile one, it\\'s still a decent portal to all the ESPN commentators and highlights you\\'d find on the cable channel. If you want live games, you\\'ll have to tack on an ESPN Plus subscription, but thankfully that\\'s just a few dollars more per month.\\n\\nDoes it require a subscription? Yes\\n\\nFor wrestling fans, the WWE Network is probably the best thing you can download from our list. It\\'s more or less an all you can stream buffet of wrestling from the last 30 years as well as the most recent PayPerView events like SummerSlam. Not only is there a TON of content to explore, but the app\\'s layout makes finding new shows and matches super simple. Woo!\\n\\nDoes it require a subscription? No\\n\\nFor years Apple TV didn\\'t have a proper Twitch app, leaving esports lovers out in the cold. Thankfully that all changed in 2019 when the world\\'s most popular video game streaming app finally came to Apple TV. The idea of watching regular gamers play something might not be everyone\\'s cup of tea, but remember Twitch is also the place you\\'ll catch all the superstars online when they\\'re practicing and many, if not all, of the world\\'s biggest esports matches.\\n\\nYou might\\'ve thought dance games died out with the Wii and Xbox Kinect, but Apple TV has kept them alive and well with Ubisoft\\'s Just Dance Now that uses the gyroscope-equipped Apple TV controller to track your moves. This free version of the game allows you to up to two songs per day without having to pay any microtransactions, allowing you to get in about 10 minutes of a workout in while grooving to some of today\\'s most popular music.\\n\\nDoes it require a subscription? Yes\\n\\nBritish Apple TV owners should check out BT Sport to get their fix of the Champions League. Across its channels you\\'ll find every Champions League match live, and BT Sport deals are available as an add-on to a BT TV package as well as an extra to BT broadband. The bad news is that one of those packages is required to watch, but that\\'s a small price to pay to watch along as one of your favourite teams hoists the UEFA trophy at the end of the season.\\n\\nDoes it require a subscription? No\\n\\nThe reason Kitchen Stories makes all these best-of lists for Apple TV is because it\\'s simply beautiful to look at thanks to its minimalistic design and HD how-to videos. The videos are set to autoplay by default meaning one recipe seamlessly cascades into the next and before long you\\'ve watched videos on how to cook a poached egg and make brioche for a half-hour. Also, we have to say, the bossanova background music is a big plus.\\n\\nDoes it require a subscription? Yes\\n\\nWhat if you could learn how to cook from Gordon Ramsay, or learn to write from Stephen King? That\\'s what Master Class promises - real classes taught by some of the world\\'s most preeminent chefs, authors, thinkers and business leaders. Admittedly the classes themselves are relatively expensive, but if you compare it to the cost of a semester\\'s tuition you\\'ll be pleasantly surprised how much info each of these classes have in them.\\n\\nDoes it require a subscription? No\\n\\nThe TED app is like your college lectures simplified down to their most essential bits and presented in a way that doesn\\'t put you to sleep. TED speakers take on some of the biggest issues facing humanity in the modern world with expert precision, unbelievable wit and, most times, a healthy dose of humor. It\\'s the kind of app that you can leave on in the background while you\\'re cooking or cleaning and tune in periodically to catch some uplifting news or find an actionable item you can use to make the world a better place.\\n\\nDoes it require a subscription? No\\n\\nWhile there\\'s no shortage of traditional news networks on Apple TV, Cheddar is part of a new wave of internet-focused news. That means Cheddar is a bit more tuned in than traditional cable networks to what\\'s happening in the tech and business space while keeping high production values and quality research. We still use CNN, NBC and CBS News for the hard-hitting stuff, but Cheddar is a solid alternative for tech enthusiasts like us.\\n\\nDoes it require a subscription? No\\n\\nOK, Calm isn\\'t exactly an education app, but it does teach you a thing or two about yourself by prompting you to meditate everyday. With guided meditations that teach you to breathe and relaxation exercises that reduce anxiety calm is a great app that\\'s totally worth taking time out for.\\n\\nHow much does it cost? \\u200e$7.99 /\\u200e £7.99 / AU$12.99\\n\\nOceanhorn is about as close as you\\'ll get to a Legend of Zelda game outside of traditional game consoles, with puzzles, actions, and locations that are very reminiscent of Nintendo\\'s classic franchise. (The intro alone makes it clear the developers are big fans of the series\\' Super NES standout A Link to the Past.) The graphics are fantastic, and present a world that promises to stay with you well beyond the end of your adventure.\\n\\nHow much does it cost? It\\'s free\\n\\nThe Apple TV version of the side-scrolling Rayman series is just as beautiful as its console cousins, and offers more control than typical auto-running iOS platformers: you can swipe left or right on the remote\\'s touchpad to change direction at any time. There\\'s lots of fun to be had even without in-app purchases, thanks to an abundance of goals per level, countless collectibles, and endless charm.\\n\\nHow much does it cost? \\u200e$4.99\\n\\nLike many of the games on this list, Transistor offers amazing visuals with a unique artistic style. Both the world and story strike a dark, noir-cyberpunk tone, with interesting characters and mysteries to unravel. The action incorporates RPG-style strategy, and can be controlled via the touchpad on the new Apple TV remote or a MFi gamepad. Buy the game on Apple TV and you\\'ll get it for iPhone and iPad too, with your save carried across all platforms via the cloud.\\n\\nHow much does it cost? It\\'s free\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for a Need for Speed arcade racer that puts the Apple TV to the test, look no further than the Asphalt series of games from Gameloft. This freemium racer has all the pizzazz of big budget AAA games, but parsed out in bite size chunks that can be completed in a few minutes. The game looks great on Apple TV and is well worth the free download.\\n\\nHow much does it cost? It\\'s free\\n\\nCrossy Road takes the endless runner franchise and adds a dash of Frogger and a whole lot of stylized cartoonish flair to it. This freemium game puts you in charge of a chicken (or unicorn, duck, crab, whale, phone box, game designer, Loch Ness Monster, etc...) and tasks you with the simple task of crossing the street without getting killed. The catch here is that the street is more like a super highway and sometimes involves high speed trains and it never really ends. Still, it\\'s fun to see how far you can get before you meet your inevitable demise.\\n\\nHow much does it cost? It\\'s free with an Apple Arcade subscription\\n\\nIf the original Oceanhorn is like A Link to the Past, Oceanhorn 2 is its Breath of the Wild older brother. The sequel to one of the Apple TV\\'s best games opens up the world a bit more, allowing you to stretch your legs and the Apple TV\\'s graphical capabilities for a beautifully wild ride. Want more of that Zelda feel? Use an Xbox One, PS4 or MFi controller to really give it that premium console quality.\\n\\nHow much does it cost? It\\'s free with an Apple Arcade subscription\\n\\nThe latest and greatest game to enter Apple Arcade\\'s stable of titles is Crossy Road Castle, a lighthearted multiplayer platformer in a procedurally generated castle. The game is similar in spirit to the original Crossy Road in that it\\'s mostly about getting as far as you can while having a laugh rather than reaching the end of the castle. The multiplayer component allows up to four players cooperate locally, which definitely adds to the hilarity of it all.\\n\\nHow much does it cost? It\\'s free with an Apple Arcade subscription\\n\\nIf you\\'ve got little ones, you\\'ve no doubt heard of Fortnite - the biggest battle royale game on the planet that pits 100 players against one another in a big open arena. That game is great for gamers of a certain age, but for little ones, even Fortnite might be a bit too much. For that crowd there\\'s Butter Royale, a food-based battle royale game that swaps sub-machine guns for croissant launches and ketchup bottles. This one keeps all the core tenets of what makes battle royale games great but puts it in a PG-rated package for everyone to enjoy.\\n\\nHow much does it cost? It\\'s free with an Apple Arcade subscription\\n\\nSpeaking of battle royale games, we\\'d be remiss if we didn\\'t mention Pac-Man Party Royale - a battle mode take on an arcade classic that\\'s really good multiplayer. The goal is simply to be the last Pac-Person standing by eating competing players ala Super Pellet or pushing them into ghosts. It\\'s an ingenious twist on an old-school classic.\\n\\nHow much does it cost? It\\'s free with an Apple Arcade subscription\\n\\nSayonara Wild Hearts is a rhythm action game that takes cues from Rez and blends them with a pop album instead of techno tracks. You blaze along a 3D track, grabbing collectables to up your score and, periodically, pressing various parts of the screen for QTE boss battles. The visuals are absolutely beautiful and the music is some of the best in any mobile game. Sure you can play this one on your phone, but this game is really made for a controller.',\n",

       "    'title': 'The 5-point 2020 iPad Pro review: One small step for Apple, one potential leap for AR',\n",
       "    'body': 'If you follow tablet computers, you know new iPad Pro releases tend to be important, since Apple always reserves its fastest A-series processors and latest top-of-line features for its premium-priced flagships. While some of these capabilities later trickled down to other models, iPad Pros were Apple\\'s first tablets with Pencil and Smart Connector support, four speakers, five microphones, TrueDepth cameras, and 11- and 12.9-inch screens.\\n\\nGiven some of these milestones, it\\'s easy to forget that Apple follows a tick-tock pattern with iPad Pro releases, alternating between big updates and minor refreshes. Mid-2017\\'s largely forgotten second-generation iPad Pro looked just like its 2015 predecessor, switching from an A9X chip to an A10X Fusion, gaining a 120Hz ProMotion screen, and boosting camera performance. Then late 2018 models debuted all-new chassis designs, Face ID, USB-C connectors, and supercharged A12X Bionic processors. I was a huge fan of the 2018 iPad Pro and have used one for hours every day since its release.\\n\\nBy comparison, Apple\\'s 2020 iPad Pro is destined to be one of the largely forgotten models. It\\'s almost exactly like the 2018 version, except for a substantially revised rear camera system and some small internal changes. Disappointingly, the \"new\" A12Z Bionic processor is only modestly faster than the old A12X. On the other hand, Apple has modestly tweaked this year\\'s storage capacities and pricing, perhaps to offset an expensive new trackpad-keyboard accessory that\\'s coming in May.\\n\\nMy executive summary: The 2020 iPad Pro still leads the tablet pack, but it doesn\\'t feel anywhere near as future-proof as its predecessor did in 2018. Here are the five key things you need to know before purchasing or passing.\\n\\nApple\\'s single biggest change to the 2020 iPad Pros is obvious from the outside: a redesigned rear camera system. 2018 iPad Pros had a single large lens akin to the iPhone XR\\'s -- a 12-Megapixel, f/1.8 aperture \"1X\" camera with no optical zoom abilities -- but the 2020 iPad Pro uses the square camera block design found in 2019\\'s iPhone 11s. Somewhat like the standard iPhone 11, Apple adds a \"0.5X,\" f/2.4 aperture ultrawide camera to the prior 1X option, but it\\'s not exactly the same configuration. The iPad\\'s second camera has only 10 megapixels and promises a 125-degree field of view, compared with the iPhone 11\\'s 0.5X specs of 12 megapixels and 120 degrees.\\n\\nOne might assume this means that the iPad Pro\\'s ultrawide pictures are a little wider than the iPhone 11\\'s, with a slightly greater ability to \"see\" the totality of a room or other space with the 0.5X lens, a feature that matters for augmented reality. You might also expect 10MP photos to be a little lower in resolution than 12MP ones. But neither assumption would be correct.\\n\\nThe iPhone 11\\'s ultrawide camera takes noticeably wider and sharper photos than the new iPad Pro\\'s. Rather than outputting the 10MP output natively, Apple upscales the pictures to 12MP so they\\'re a little less sharp on close inspection. And the iPad Pro doesn\\'t smoothly zoom between 0.5X and 1X when you hit the zoom out button in Apple\\'s Camera app.\\n\\nAnother twist is that the iPad Pro\\'s 1X camera isn\\'t quite as wide as the iPhone 11\\'s. The difference here is less noticeable, but you can see it. Images from the devices\\' 7MP front cameras are comparatively indistinguishable.\\n\\nFor reasons that aren\\'t yet entirely clear, Apple is focusing a lot of attention on the 2020 iPad Pro\\'s potential as an augmented reality display device. As was predicted by supply chain analysts some time ago, the new iPad also adds 3D scanning capabilities in the form of a lidar (light detection and ranging) sensor that uses laser pulses to digitally map environments, objects, and people within a five-meter range. For most people, this sensor will have comparatively less value than the iPhone 11 Pro\\'s third (2X) camera. Instead of being able to optically zoom in whenever you\\'re shooting images, the lidar capability is there solely for AR apps.\\n\\nRight now, one of the only two ways to test the lidar sensor\\'s abilities is to load Apple\\'s previously underwhelming Measure app, which used comparative photography to estimate the size and measurements of objects, and note that it now returns results that are more accurate than before. They\\'re not always perfect; in the shot below, Measure guesstimated a 7-inch length at 6.5 inches, though it was closer to spot-on in other readings, and faster besides.\\n\\nThe other way is to load prior AR apps and note that they\\'re faster at acquiring positioning data and adjusting digital elements than before. But developers will need to use ARKit 3.5, literally just released this week, to really take advantage of the new lidar hardware. You can preview how it will work using the Safari browser\\'s AR feature, triggered by certain pages on Apple\\'s website. Here, a digital iPad Pro is occluded by a real-world foreground object. The occlusion is unrealistically blurry at this point, but with the prior-generation iPad Pro, the digital model appears to be overlapping everything rather than blending in at all.\\n\\nFrom where I stand, Apple\\'s pattern of adding new tentpole hardware features to its devices without adequate software support has become tiring and occasionally problematic. As just one example, 3D Touch in iPhones was supposed to be a big deal but went nowhere with developers and eventually disappeared from new models. But unlike 3D Touch, which was merely one of multiple new \"major\" iPhone features in its day, the lidar sensor is the signature differentiator between this iPad and its predecessor. It could be viewed as ahead of its time, but it\\'s also a feature no one was asking for in a tablet.\\n\\nWill lidar see much use from developers? Just like 3D Touch, that remains to be seen. Despite the hardware\\'s potential, it\\'s hard to call it a giant leap forward for AR without great software, and Apple largely dropped the ball on delivering anything compelling for the new iPad Pro\\'s launch.\\n\\nIt\\'s reasonable to speculate that Apple rolled out lidar to help a small but growing number of companies bolster their still nascent AR retail efforts -- making an online store\\'s digital sofas look like they\\'re really in your living room -- or help them prototype lidar-based AR games that will eventually debut on iPhones and Apple glasses. Only the passage of time will determine whether these camera tweaks alone justified a new iPad Pro launch.\\n\\nIf there\\'s any single huge surprise with the 2020 iPad Pro, it\\'s what hasn\\'t changed from the 2018 model -- overall performance. As disclosed by spec sheets, the new iPad has an A12Z series chip, the first time Apple has used a \"Z\" as a suffix for one of its custom A-series processors. The name was apparently meant to signal that the A12Z is a slight upgrade from 2018\\'s A12X, rather than the generational or process technology leap one might have expected from an A13X or A14X, either of which would have been expected, given the iPad Pro\\'s upgrade history.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the A12Z doesn\\'t appear to be much different from the A12X in performance -- a real bummer, given the 1.5-year spread between releases. On the CPU side, Geekbench 5\\'s single-core (1105) and multi-core (4692) numbers for the new iPad Pro are virtually identical to scores posted for the 2018 iPad Pro (averaging 1110/4600), while its GPU-focused Metal compute benchmark (9938) is between 7% and 13% better than 2018\\'s range of 8800-9304, thanks to one additional GPU core -- up to eight from the A12X\\'s seven. (Note: There are small variations between prior 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro benchmark scores, based on RAM and screen resolution differences.)\\n\\nA comprehensive system-wide benchmark, Antutu, pegs the new iPad Pro at 742712 versus 2018\\'s 716358, a performance boost of only 3.7% between the A12X and A12Z. The higher number reflects improvements to both the GPU (383239 from 363953) and memory (94708 from 88457), with barely any changes in CPU or UX scores.\\n\\nWireless performance is supposed to be a little better on the new iPad Pro, but I didn\\'t see it in my tests. Like the iPhone 11 series, Apple has upgraded the new iPad Pro to Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) -- the latest wireless standard, which is only just beginning to see router support. I have a 1-Gigabit per second connection with Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) and saw download speeds ranging from 372-522Mbps on the new iPad, compared with 331-528Mbps on the prior model. Upload speeds hit the service\\'s sub-40Mbps cap.\\n\\nThere are smaller under-the-hood hardware changes, as well. Apple has upgraded the quality of the 2018 model\\'s five-microphone array, lowering the noise floor and improving clarity. In addition to helping with direct-from-device audio recording, this may enable Siri to \"hear\" speech better during standard queries and dictation.\\n\\nIt\\'s also been claimed, without documentation, that Apple added its semi-mysterious U1 ultra wideband location chip to the iPad Pro, having debuted it almost pointlessly in the iPhone 11. The chip is eventually supposed to enable more precise geographic location of any device it\\'s inside of, as well as faster data transfers between proximate devices. But for now, it\\'s largely a curiosity, supported only by Apple\\'s AirDrop feature. I saw no evidence in the iPad Pro\\'s current AirDrop interface that U1 is actually inside the new tablet.\\n\\nApple continues to specify each model at 10 hours of battery life -- numbers they will almost always meet or exceed, apart from the most GPU-demanding applications, though they can fall well below that for games and will begin to show signs of decreased longevity after a year or a year and a half of daily battery use. While this year\\'s 12.9-inch iPad Pro has the same battery capacity as its predecessor, the new 11-inch model has a slightly smaller battery to make space for the larger camera module, which means its run times are likely to be a little lower.\\n\\nJust as was the case in 2018, each iPad Pro comes with a one-meter USB-C to USB-C cable and an 18-watt USB-C wall charger -- lower than its supported peak charging speed of 45 watts. So if you\\'re looking for a second or replacement charger, Aukey\\'s compact GaN charger Omnia Mix (above) offers laptop-class 65 watts of power and two ports for $50, while a smaller Minima model delivers 18 watts in a much smaller housing for only $22.\\n\\nAs I said during my otherwise positive review of the last iPad Pro, Apple\\'s hardware was legitimately awesome by late 2018 hardware standards but crippled by its inability to serve as a convertible replacement for a laptop -- something Microsoft has unquestionably done better with its Surface tablets. This year, Apple is finally addressing the deficit, though there are at least three necessary steps in the process and they\\'re all at different stages of completion.\\n\\nThe first step was enabling the iPad to work with not only external keyboards, as has been an option since 2010, but more specifically hybrid keyboard and trackpad accessories. Apple added preliminary trackpad and mouse support to iPadOS 13.0 last year, then surprised everyone by upgrading the feature to full system-wide support in iPadOS 13.4 this week. As of today, users can use Bluetooth 5.0 or a USB-C cable to connect the new iPad Pros (and many past iPads) to trackpads and mice, as well as future combined keyboard-trackpad solutions.\\n\\nThere will be at least three types of combined accessories: Apple\\'s own iPad Pro Magic Keyboards (above), which will arrive in May for $299 (11-inch) or $349 (12.9-inch); Apple-overseen alternatives such as Logitech\\'s $150 Combo Touch, also arriving in May; and independently designed alternatives such as Brydge\\'s Pro Plus, a $200/$230 design scheduled for mid-April. Each design is substantially different from the others.\\n\\nApple\\'s Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro evolves its vinyl and microfiber Smart Folio with a combined keyboard and trackpad that look like smaller versions of those parts on a MacBook laptop. For whatever reason, Apple omits all of the dedicated function keys found on its Mac keyboards but does include scissor switch key mechanisms and a multi-touch trackpad. Apart from the possibly glass trackpad and plastic keys, the keyboard housing appears to be metal, and the iPad is held above the typing surface with an adjustable cantilevered hinge. A pass-through USB-C port can be used to charge the iPad and Magic Keyboard at the same time.\\n\\nLogitech\\'s Combo Touch has only been announced for lower-end iPads, but it demonstrates that a functionally similar accessory can be had for half of Apple\\'s prices. Like Microsoft\\'s Surface keyboards, this design uses a fabric and plastic housing and relies on a kickstand to prop the iPad up, which may be less than ideal for use on a lap. However, the case provides full iPad protection, and the backlit keyboard includes a row of function keys, unlike Apple\\'s.\\n\\nBrydge\\'s Pro Plus (above, stylized Pro+) looks substantially like the bottom casing of a MacBook. Made from space gray machined aluminum, it has a full plastic backlit keyboard and multi-touch trackpad, its own battery (with three-month longevity), a metal hinge, and a protective frame to hold the iPad Pro. Like Logitech\\'s design and unlike Apple\\'s, it has a set of function keys beyond the basic five rows of inputs.\\n\\nIt\\'s unclear at this point how any of these solutions will compare with a traditional laptop. But Apple\\'s certainly a lot closer than it was a year and a half ago.\\n\\nViewed from a 20,000-foot perspective, the iPad Pro\\'s software experience is pretty good today -- assuming you can live with iPadOS-limited versions of apps, which are presently in a state of flux. Most are optimized to take up the full screen of an 11-inch or 12.9-inch display, regardless of whether it\\'s in landscape or portrait mode, which I continue to view as a suboptimal way of using such large screens. But semi-awkward split screen options are also available.\\n\\nFor the past decade, the general trend has been toward bringing iPhone apps ever closer to their desktop equivalents, which will continue with future keyboard/trackpad updates and Apple\\'s macOS Catalyst initiative. But there\\'s no doubt that even professional-specific iPad apps, such as Adobe\\'s latest release of Photoshop, aren\\'t up to par with macOS/Windows versions or likely to reach that level over the next year.\\n\\nApple has made enough screen size tweaks to iPads over the years that there\\'s no guarantee any given model will have 100% native software screen support. iPad Pros graduated from Apple\\'s prior 9.7-inch standard iPad size to 10.5- and 11- inch displays, but as of our 2018 iPad Pro review, there was very little software optimized for the newest screen -- most apps displayed with black borders. All four 12.9-inch iPad Pro generations have kept the same screen size, but the 2018 model lost its Home button, requiring small software tweaks. Even today, some apps continue to have black borders on the 12.9-inch Pro screen (shown below).\\n\\nIt\\'s fair to say that most major iPad apps have proper support for both the 11-inch and 12.9-inch displays, with the vast majority also supporting multiple split-screen multitasking features. However, there are plenty of legacy iPadOS-ready exceptions that still have small black bars on at least 11-inch iPad Pros, such as Algoriddim\\'s Djay Pro and NBC\\'s SNL app, as well as numerous games, like Activision\\'s Geometry Wars 3 and Namco\\'s Pac-Man CE DX. These are in addition to iPhone-focused apps that still haven\\'t been optimized for any iPad screen -- including Instagram, DoorDash, and Postmates -- and continue to run in portrait mode with large black bars.\\n\\nAll of this could change. On the iPad side, Apple says that by April 30, 2020 \"all apps that run on iPhone must support all iPhone screens and all apps that run on iPad must support all iPad screens\" -- assuming developers want to submit or resubmit apps for App Store approval. Additionally, Apple\\'s Catalyst software is strongly incentivizing third-party developers to create Mac apps that also run on iPads, with device-specific interfaces. But we\\'ll have to wait and see whether these initiatives push developers to make good use of current-generation iPad Pro displays and capabilities or they\\'ll just bow out of future app updates.\\n\\nOnce the new Magic Keyboard is out, the iPad Pro\\'s only limitations compared with a MacBook Air will be its software and iPadOS. I\\'m optimistic that both will continue to improve over time, but despite Apple\\'s numerous iPad multitasking iterations, I still find the Mac\\'s windowed approach far superior for work and wish the iPad Pros made better use of their large, beautiful screens.\\n\\nAlthough the new iPad Pro was only modestly refreshed for 2020, Apple does deserve some credit for one other tweak this year: value pricing. Beyond updating the camera system, Apple has boosted each entry level model\\'s storage capacity to 128GB, enabling most customers to get a perfectly viable device for $799 (11-inch) or $999 (12.9-inch). Previously, the entry level models were stuck with only 64GB, a marginal capacity for many prospective uses.\\n\\nWhile Apple still makes plenty of money off upgraded storage, it has shaved $50 off the cost of 256GB ($899/$1099), 512GB ($1099/$1299), and 1TB ($1299/$1499) models and quietly includes 6GB of RAM inside every iPad Pro -- not just the 1TB 12.9-inch model, which previously had 6GB while all other models had only 4GB. Although cellular models still carry steep $150 premiums, Apple\\'s educational discounts knock $50 off any 11-inch model or $100 off any 12.9-inch model.\\n\\nAll of this is to say that both new models deliver superior value for the dollar, compared with their predecessors, though the differences aren\\'t night and day. Moreover, if you factor in the cost of a $299+ iPad Pro Magic Keyboard and/or $129 Apple Pencil, an iPad Pro still isn\\'t going to be a small purchase. And as I noted earlier, this year\\'s models don\\'t feel anywhere near as future-proof as their predecessors did in 2018. The iPad Pro\\'s lead over pure tablet rivals was huge at that point, but A12Z is only a small step forward.\\n\\nAfter nearly two decades of reviewing Apple products, the biggest challenge I face in recommending 2020\\'s iPad Pros is institutional knowledge -- users have been burned before with half-step upgrades and seven-month hardware refreshes. Consequently, this isn\\'t a model I\\'d recommend to most purchasers of the 2018 iPad Pro, and I\\'m hesitant to suggest that anyone else buy into it -- absent a very concrete need for either 2018-caliber flagship tablet performance or AR-specific features.\\n\\nNo one outside Apple knows whether there will be another, fancier iPad Pro release later this year, or whether it will wait until 2021. But since the A12 series will be at least two full processor generations behind at that point, I feel certain that the next model will represent as giant a leap forward for the iPad\\'s performance as the lidar sensor could be for its AR functionality.\\n\\nSo if you\\'re considering the purchase of a 2020 iPad Pro, here\\'s my advice: Unless you expect to aggressively use the improved camera system, look for a discontinued 2018 model instead. It runs 99.99% of software identically, delivers virtually the same performance, and works with a larger variety of cases that are readily available from retailers during the COVID-19 outbreak. The 2020 iPad Pro is a slightly better piece of hardware, but its improvements won\\'t matter to most users, and at Apple\\'s flagship prices you should expect more than just small year-over-year gains.',\n",

       "    'title': 'Could We Still See an Apple Services Bundle This Year?',\n",
       "    'body': 'Ever since Apple introduced a whole lineup of new services last year many customers have been wishing for a way to bundle one or more of these services like Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and Apple News+ into one lower monthly subscription fee.\\n\\nIn fact, many expected that would be in the cards even before Apple announced its new services, but sadly it never came to pass, and other than remaining within the warm embrace of the Apple ecosystem, there\\'s no direct benefit for most users in subscribing to more than one Apple service, so an Apple TV+ user could just as easily use Spotify for their playlists instead of Apple Music; there aren\\'t even any integrations between services that would help to encourage users to stay in the Apple ecosystem.\\n\\nWhile this likely helps Apple avoid more antitrust allegations, it\\'s making many of the company\\'s services seem like silos, and any tie-ins that the company is considering appear to be more on the front-end production side than offering tight integration between the apps. By contrast, thanks to a partnership with Tidal, media streaming company Plex now provides a list of music tracks on its pages for popular TV shows and movies, letting users quickly access those songs -- as long as they have a Tidal subscription, of course.\\n\\nLate last year, however, we heard rumours that Apple was in the very least looking for ways to offer one or more of its services in a single subscription, but other than a limited-time student promotion, the company hasn\\'t yet made any obvious moves in that direction.\\n\\nThe biggest obstacle to this, of course, is the music industry, which would likely need to be willing to give up a portion of the revenue that it receives from Apple Music to let Apple effectively reduce the price of the service in a bundle. Since these two services seem to have the most natural synergy, Apple was reportedly in talks with the record labels about doing so last year, but now it appears like these talks haven\\'t gone anywhere.\\n\\nA new report from the Financial Times reveals that Apple has recently renewed its multi-year deals with the major record labels to keep their content on Apple Music, but in the midst of these new agreements, there appears to be no room for an Apple TV+ bundle.\\n\\nSpecifically, Apple has sealed \"multiyear licensing deals\" with Universal Music, Sony Music, and Warner Music, according to people who are familiar with the matter, however the same sources note that the contracts do not \"include an economic agreement to bundle Apple Music with the company\\'s television service.\"\\n\\nAs an aside, it\\'s also interesting to note that Apple\\'s much more friendly relationship with music publishers seems to have smoothed over these negotiations. Apple\\'s chief rival, Spotify, has been struggling for almost a year now to come to an agreement with at least two of the big labels, with the previous contract being extended on a month-by-month basis while they continue their \"high-stakes discussions.\"\\n\\nTechnically speaking, this doesn\\'t rule out Apple\\'s ability to bundle its services, as the agreements with the music labels can\\'t prevent Apple from doing that. What these new contracts do represent, however, is that the record companies haven\\'t made any financial concessions that would allow Apple to pay lower royalty rates as part of a bundle.\\n\\nThis means that if Apple wanted to sell a subscription bundle that includes Apple Music, it would basically have to eat the costs of doing so from the profits of its own services. Such a move wouldn\\'t be entirely unprecedented, though -- the Apple Music and Apple TV+ Student Bundle did exactly that, and in fact Apple even positioned it as such, telling Apple Music student subscribers that they were getting \"Apple TV+ included at no extra charge.\"\\n\\nSince Apple owns all of the content rights for the shows on Apple TV+ and the games on Apple Arcade, this does give the company considerably more freedom to set the rates for these services. For example, if Apple wanted bundle Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade, it wouldn\\'t need to worry about the economic arrangements with third-party publishers. Only Apple Music and Apple News+ actually require any kind of per-subscriber payouts to third-parties, however with Apple News+ struggling to gain traction, Apple might have an easier sell in convincing news and magazine publishers to agree to a bundle, not to mention that by all reports Apple gets a much bigger cut on News+ subscriptions than it does from Apple Music.\\n\\nSo it still remains unclear whether we\\'ll see an Apple Digital Super Bundle sometime this year, although if Apple is considering any such thing, it\\'s most likely going to come in the fall when free one-year trials of Apple TV+ start running out.',\n",

       "    'title': \"Apple's Dark Sky acquisition is the latest move in the company's master plan to grow its biggest product other than the iPhone (AAPL)\",\n",
       "    'body': \"Apple just acquired the beloved weather app Dark Sky, a move that could help it boost its ever-growing services division.\\n\\nApple's services category has become an increasingly important revenue driver for the company after several consecutive quarters of sluggish iPhone sales. The acquisition makes sense considering Apple has been launching new digital products and improving its own iPhone apps in recent years. It could also add more fuel to the argument that Apple makes it difficult for smaller app makers to compete against Apple's own services. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories .\\n\\nApple just acquired the popular weather app Dark Sky , a move that gives the iPhone maker another avenue to expand its ever-growing services division. That category has become increasingly important for the Apple as it seeks to become less reliant on smartphone sales.\\n\\nDark Sky announced the acquisition in a blog post on Monday, although the terms of the deal have not been disclosed. The iOS app will remain unchanged, but those using Dark Sky on Android or Google's Wear OS smartwatch platform will only have access to the app until July 1. The company will also continue to support its application programming interface a set of tools and protocols that allows other developers to integrate Dark Sky data into their own weather apps for existing customers through the end of 2021.\\n\\nApple's decision to purchase Dark Sky makes sense when you look at the company's direction in recent years. The firm gradually has been building its services division and shifting the focus to its software offerings, particularly while iPhone sales have declined as consumers have been upgrading their devices less frequently.\\n\\nRoughly a year ago, for example, it held an entire special event dedicated to new digital offerings like Apple TV Plus, Apple Arcade, and Apple News Plus, a rare move for a company that usually only holds press conferences to announce new hardware.\\n\\nApple's booming services division BusinessInsider USA Images\\n\\nApple\\n\\nApple's services division, which encompasses App Store purchases as well as subscriptions like Apple Arcade, iCloud, and Apple Care, now accounts for more quarterly revenue than the iPad and the Mac. In fact, it generates more quarterly revenue than any Apple product other than the iPhone.\\n\\nIn Apple's fiscal first quarter of 2020 , services generated $12.7 billion in revenue, while the Mac division generated $7.1 billion and the iPad was responsible for $5.9 billion. When Apple's iPhone revenue saw several consecutive quarterly declines over the course of 2018 and 2019, Apple's services and wearables divisions were a bright spot.\\n\\nNow, with the acquisition of Dark Sky (which costs $3.99 in Apple's App Store) the company has yet another possible revenue stream to add to its burgeoning services division.\\n\\nApple's possible plans for Dark Sky BusinessInsider USA Images\\n\\nApple\\n\\nIt's unclear precisely what Apple plans to do with Dark Sky, but there are plenty of possibilities. Apple already has premium apps either developed in-house or through acquisitions for many popular app categories. These include music (Apple Music), news (Apple News Plus), streaming entertainment (Apple TV Plus), personal finance (Apple Card), and gaming (Apple Arcade).\\n\\nAdding weather to the portfolio seems like a sensible addition, especially considering Apple is rumored to be working on a bundled offering that would include multiple services for the one price. A subscription that provides a premium weather app along with the news, for instance, seems like a natural pairing.\\n\\nThere's also the possibility that Apple could use data from Dark Sky simply to bolster its existing core iPhone apps, like the weather app and Siri. Apple's stock apps have been the focus of its major iPhone updates in recent years, so it's plausible to think that Apple could use Dark Sky as part of planned improvements to the weather app in iOS 14 and beyond. Last year's iOS 13 update brought major upgrades to other Apple apps like Health, Reminders, and Photos.\\n\\nMore ammunition for antitrust arguments BusinessInsider USA Images\\n\\nGetty\\n\\nRegardless of Apple's plans, the acquisition likely won't bode well for its reputation as it relates to concerns over potentially anticompetitive business practices. Over the last year, large firms like Apple, Google, Amazon, and Facebook have come under scrutiny from lawmakers who have argued that the size and influence of these tech giants hampers competition.\\n\\nApple has been in the spotlight because it runs the iPhone's App Store while also offering its own services that compete directly with those found in the store. Buying Dark Sky has given Apple another asset in competing with third-party apps, an addition that probably won't assuage recent antitrust woes.\\n\\nLast year was a milestone era for Apple services, and if the Dark Sky acquisition reveals anything, it's that Apple isn't slowing down anytime soon.\\n\\nSee Also:\\n\\nApple was founded in a garage on this day in 1976. Now the Apple Museum is building its very own replica. Apple was started in a garage on this day in 1976. Here are the modest beginnings of 5 tech companies worth billions today. Apple just bought the beloved weather app Dark Sky, and it's shutting down the Android version\",\n",

       "    'title': 'Apple Card gets updated privacy policy on new data sharing and more transaction detail - TechCrunch',\n",
       "    'body': 'Apple is updating its privacy policy for Apple Card to enable sharing more anonymized data with Goldman Sachs, its financial partner. Apple\\'s reasoning here is that this will make it able to do a better job of assigning credit to new customers.\\n\\nThe data is aggregate and anonymized, and there is an opt-out.\\n\\nThree things are happening here:\\n\\nAs a side effect of the Apple Card policy evolving here it\\'s also being split off from the Apple Pay privacy policy. Much of the language is either identical or nearly so, but this allows Apple to make changes like the ones above to Apple Card without having to interleave that with the Apple Pay policy -- as not all Apple Pay customers are Apple Card customers.\\n\\nThe new policy appears in iOS 13.4 updates but the opt-in sharing of data points will not immediately roll out for new Apple Card users and will begin appearing later.\\n\\nHere is the additional language that is appearing in the Apple Card privacy notice related to data sharing, with some sections highlighted by us:\\n\\n\"You may be eligible for certain Apple Card programs provided by Goldman Sachs based on the information provided as part of your application. Apple may know whether you receive the invitation to participate and whether you accept or decline the invitation, and may share that information with Goldman Sachs to effectuate the program. Apple will not know additional details about your participation in the program.\\n\\nApple may use information about your account with Apple, such as the fact that you have Apple Card, for internal research and analytics purposes, such as financial forecasting. Apple may also use information about your relationship with Apple, such as what Apple products you have purchased, how long you have had your Apple ID, and how often you transact with Apple, to improve Apple Card by helping to identify Apple metrics that may assist Goldman Sachs in improving credit decisioning. No personally identifiable information about your relationship with Apple will be shared with Goldman Sachs to identify the relevant Apple metrics. You can opt out of this use or your Apple relationship information by emailing our privacy team at dpo@apple.com with the subject line \"Apple Relationship Data and Apple Card.\" Applicants and cardholders may be able to choose to share the identified metrics with Goldman Sachs for re-evaluation of their offer of credit or to increase their credit line. Apple may share information about your relationship with Apple with our service providers, who are obligated to handle the information consistent with this notice and Apple instructions, are required to use reasonable security measures to protect any personal information received, and must delete the personal information as soon as they have completed the services.\"\\n\\nSome thoughts on all of this.\\n\\nThe fact that Apple is sharing a new anonymized, non-personally identifiable information (PII), customer model with Goldman likely engenders two valid responses.\\n\\nFirst, there is more data being shared here than there was before, which is always something that should be examined closely, and all of us should be as cognizant as possible about how much information gets traded around about us. That said, your average co-branded card offer (say an airline card or retailer card) is controlled nearly entirely by the financial services side of that equation (basically the credit card companies decide what data they get and how).\\n\\nApple\\'s deal with Goldman Sachs is unique in a lot of ways, not the least of which is that Apple has controlled the flow of data from customers to Goldman very tightly from the beginning. Evidenced by affordances it continues to offer like skipping your March payment to Apple Card without incurring interest. This new arrangement outlined in the privacy policy does not share any PII unless there is an opt-in, and even allows an opt-out of the anonymized model share.\\n\\nI cannot stress enough how rare that is in financial products, especially credit cards. Most cards take all of the above information and much more in their approval process, and they don\\'t do any work beyond what is required by regulatory law to inform you of that. Apple is doing more than most.\\n\\nTHAT SAID. I do wish that the opt-out of the anonymized data model was presented in the flow of normal signup, rather than existing as an email address in the privacy policy. I know why this is, because the model is likely far more effective and a lot more people will likely get approved for an Apple Card using it.\\n\\nBut in keeping with the stated Apple goals of protecting user privacy and making the policy as transparent as possible I would prefer that they find a long-term solution that communicates all of those factors to the user clearly and then offers them the ability to risk non-approval but limiting data share.\\n\\nThe idea behind the new model sharing and the secondary opt-in disclosure of 9 key bits of actually personal information about your purchase history and other things is that Apple will be able to offer credit to people who may be automatically rejected under the old way of doing things. And, out beyond that, it will be able to build tools that help customers to manage debt and credit more accurately and transparently. Especially those new to credit.\\n\\nAny time an agreement changes to enable more data to flow my eyebrows arch. But there is a pretty straight line to be drawn here between the way that Apple transparently and aggressively helps users to not pay interest on Apple Card and the potential for more useful financial product enhancements to Apple Card down the line.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve ever looked at a credit card statement you know that it can often be difficult to ascertain exactly how much you need to pay at any given time to avoid interest. In the Apple Card interface it\\'s insanely clear exactly how and when to pay so that you don\\'t get charged. Most of the industry follows practices that prey on behavioral norms -- people will pay the minimum payment by default because that\\'s what seems logical, rather than paying what is most healthy for them to pay.\\n\\nMy hope here is that the additional modeling makes room for more of these kinds of product decisions for Apple Card down the line. But, my eyes are up and yours should be too. Check the policy, opt-out if it makes sense to you and always be aware of the data you\\'re sharing, who with and what they plan to use it for.',\n",

       "    'title': 'Why I Sold All My Apple Shares | The Motley Fool',\n",
       "    'body': 'I love looking at the \"story\" behind investments from an interdisciplinary point of view, with an equal appetite for high-growth disruptors and beaten-down value names.\\n\\nMany readers know that I and others at the Fool are tremendous fans of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The iPhone giant is an absolutely dominant consumer franchise, and it\\'s no surprise that Forbes magazine ranked it as the world\\'s most valuable brand earlier this year.\\n\\nI had trimmed some of my very large position in February and sold a call against my Apple shares in January as the stock surged toward new all-time highs. However, given recent global events, I reluctantly sold more of my shares in the mid-to-high $200s in recent weeks, and then completely out of the stock on Wednesday, March 18, at prices I would have scoffed at as recently as one month ago.\\n\\nThat looks to have been an OK decision in the short term, as Apple\\'s price has traded lower since then. Yet the Motley Fool\\'s disclosure policy has precluded me from writing about the sale until now.\\n\\nObviously, coronavirus has changed my outlook on Apple quite substantially from the bullish opinion I had even fairly recently. However, I\\'m not recommending every investor sell now -- even if you think Apple may trade lower in the near term.\\n\\nStill, I feel the sale was the right decision for my own situation, so check my reasons to see if they apply to yours.\\n\\nWhile iPhone owners will no doubt continue to make their phones the center of their daily lives, Apple\\'s near-term revenue and earnings will largely depend on new devices sold in the current year. In addition to devices, Apple has also been growing a slew of new services in 2019. The prospect of these new services, as well as rejuvenated iPhone 11 sales, were factors that got me excited about Apple back in the fall, right before Apple\\'s multiple expanded from a value multiple to a growth multiple and the stock surged 50%.\\n\\nHowever, with the prospect of a potential looming recession resulting from the coronavirus, investors now have to shift from a growth-oriented bull market mentality to perhaps a recession-oriented mentality. And while Apple has proved itself to be a fantastic brand over time, it does sell premium-priced products.\\n\\nThere also isn\\'t a whole lot of historical data regarding how iPhone sales, which make up over half of Apple\\'s revenue, might perform during an economic recession. After all, the iPhone was only introduced in June 2007, just a year before the great financial crisis of 2008. Therefore, Apple is now in uncharted territory as to how global phone sales will perform in the near term, given both demand and supply shocks it\\'s experienced during the outbreak.\\n\\nIn addition to its core devices, it\\'s also a dubious proposition to think Apple might sell a lot of its new services in the near term. After all, consumers are now probably trying to limit the amount of subscriptions they have, not try new ones. That will make it harder for Apple\\'s new streaming service to catch on against the known quantity of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), or for the Apple Arcade video to go against existing video game platforms, and it will probably dampen new Apple card signups.\\n\\nI also don\\'t think these headwinds have been fully reflected in Apple\\'s stock price as of yet, as Apple had recently surged to a decade-high P/E valuation in the October-February period. While the stock has of course given up some of those gains, it hasn\\'t reverted all the way back to prior valuation levels seen in the troughs of 2014, 2016, or late 2018, despite this uncertainty.\\n\\nIn fact, Apple has outperformed during this downturn thus far, especially when compared with the broader market. Despite its recent fall, Apple\\'s stock is still up about 60% from its January 2019 lows. If you had told me in January 2019, when I was buying more Apple stock, that the stock would be up 60% in a little over a year, I would have taken that in a heartbeat. Now everyone thinks the current price is cheap.\\n\\nOf course, Apple is a much better company than most in the index, and it\\'s also why Apple had held an outsize allocation in my personal portfolio. With Apple beginning to make up such a huge portion of my net worth -- especially as other stocks I owned have fallen by much more -- and with shares down \"only\" about 20% from recent all-time highs at the time of sale -- selling Apple was my best opportunity to raise liquidity in the interim.\\n\\nRaising cash was necessary for two reasons. First, I wanted to boost my cash on hand. In retrospect, my personal emergency fund should have probably been larger than it was. Every investor should make sure he or she has enough cash and liquidity available for a few months, especially in these unpredictable times, and given the historically fast and unpredictable nature of the current crisis, I felt raising a bit more cash was prudent. Perhaps this is being too conservative, but it\\'s probably better to be more conservative this early on in the crisis than not. For that reason, selling Apple was my best option.\\n\\nStill, not all of my Apple proceeds have gone into cash. The second reason for raising cash is to carefully go bargain-hunting for other stocks that have been hit much, much worse than Apple. In fact, while I made the large Apple sale, I\\'ve also been making several buys -- though I\\'m wading into these positions more carefully.\\n\\nFor instance, on Wednesday I bought more shares of Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), which at that point was down nearly 50% from its all-time highs. I also went bottom-feeding on Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA), which at one point was down over 65% from its all-time highs. These are both strong consumer discretionary franchises like Apple that, while sure to experience a tough 2020, should survive the crisis and continue normal operations at some point in the future.\\n\\nEven more remarkable is that both companies have traditionally traded at much higher P/E ratios than Apple in the past. Yet during this crash, both actually became cheaper than Apple last week, at least temporarily -- a hugely rare occurrence.\\n\\nI also added to my stake in small-cap server company Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). This company sells servers to businesses and cloud giants, and recent reports have pointed to a huge surge in demand for bandwidth from businesses and consumers alike, which should increase demand for server capacity. A March 10 report from memory and storage research site DrameXchange described rising server demand for the current and next quarter, both from the new JEDI cloud contract and the recent surge in demand for teleworking services. That should lead to rising demand for Super Micro Computer\\'s products, even while consumer demand for iPhones and Apple devices could decline.\\n\\nLike Apple, Super Micro also has a strong balance sheet, with about $200 million in net cash -- nearly a quarter of its market capitalization. With the stock falling almost 50% to just a 10 P/E ratio, its balance sheet in solid shape, and a potential increase in demand for its servers, Super Micro became another bargain-priced stock that I couldn\\'t resist. To buy more Super Micro, I needed to sell something, and that was Apple.\\n\\nWhile my Apple sale was appropriate for my situation, investors need to assess their own investing style and allocation risk. Foolish investors will probably be more diversified than I was, which not only eliminates near-term risk but also allows one to stay invested for the long term. I\\'m absolutely positive Apple will one day be making new highs, so those with a long enough time horizon, an ample emergency fund, and more diversification wouldn\\'t necessarily need to make the sale that I did.\\n\\nI could also very well be making a mistake. After all, Apple has one of the best balance sheets in the business, and should the economic slowdown prove short-lived, it\\'s quite possible Apple could surge to new highs as recently as this year. By selling, I also have to pay capital gains taxes on my long-term profits -- though fortunately (or unfortunately?) I have offsetting losses from other positions I\\'ve sold this year as well.\\n\\nStill, I also think there is a real possibility that Apple hasn\\'t yet caught up with the rest of the market in falling to its December 2018 valuation levels. Given the absurd bargains that have arisen in other parts of the market, selling Apple and rebalancing to other opportunities as described seemed like the best option. For those with outsize positions in Apple, it\\'s a risk you need to consider.\\n\\nStill, I\\'m fairly sure there will be a day when I will be an excited Apple shareholder again -- perhaps soon. While I offloaded shares, I also sold a put option on Apple\\'s stock last week. That means I collect a cash premium now, but if Apple shares fall below the strike price of the put option, I\\'ll be on the hook to buy 100 shares at those lower levels -- though the strike price on the option I sold is $100. It\\'s a pretty huge long shot we\\'ll ever see those prices again, even in a recession. Yet if Apple shares fall significantly from their current perch, I\\'ll be looking to buy back in to this top stock that, despite last month\\'s decline, had delivered outstanding gains for me over many years. One day, I\\'m sure it will again.',\n",

       "    'title': \"Inside iPhone 8: Apple's A11 Bionic introduces 5 new custom silicon engines - iPhone Discussions on AppleInsider Forums\",\n",
       "    'body': 'Apple\\'s new A11 Bionic chip used in iPhone 8 and the upcoming iPhone X packs in an array of processing cores and sophisticated controllers, each optimized for specific tasks. We only know a bit about these, let alone what else is packed into this SoC. Here\\'s a look at the new Apple GPU, Neural Engine, its 6 core CPU, NVMe SSD controller and new custom video encoder inside the package.\\n\\nApple\\'s first internally-designed GPU, built into the A11 Bionic Application Processor, claims to be 30 percent faster than the Imagination-based GPU used in iPhone 7 models--which was already the leading graphics architecture in smartphones.\\n\\nJust as impressively, Apple\\'s new GPU isn\\'t just faster but more efficient, allowing it to match the work of the A10 Fusion GPU using only half the energy.\\n\\nGPUs were originally created to accelerate graphics, but for years they have been tasked with doing other kinds of math with a similar repetitive nature, often referred to \"General Purpose GPU.\" Apple initially created OpenCL as an API to perform GPGPU, and more recently folded GPGPU Compute into its Metal API that\\'s optimized specifically for the GPUs Apple uses in its iOS devices and Macs. The latest version, Metal 2, was detailed at WWDC17 this summer.\\n\\nNow that Apple is designing both the graphics silicon and the software to manage it, expect even faster progress in GPU and GPGPU advancement. Additionally, Apple is also branching out into Machine Learning, one of the tasks that GPUs are particularly good at crunching. ML involves building a model based on a variety of known things--such as photos of different flowers--and using that model of \"knowledge\" to find and identify matches--things that could be flowers in other new photos, or in the camera viewfinder.\\n\\nApple hasn\\'t yet provided many technical details about its new GPU design, other than that it has \"three cores.\" Different GPU designs are optimized for specific tasks and strategies and define \"core\" in radically different ways, so it\\'s impossible to make direct, meaningful comparisons against GPUs from Intel, Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm, ARM Mali and others. It is noteworthy that Apple describes its new mobile A11 Bionic GPU Family 4 graphics architecture as using Tile Based Deferred Rendering. TBDR is a rendering technology created for mobile devices with limited resources. It effectively only finishes rendering objects that will be visible to the user in the 3D scene. On desktop PC GPUs (as well as Qualcomm Adreno and ARM Mali mobile GPUs) \"Immediate Mode\" rendering is performed on every triangle in the scene, running through rasterization and fragment function stages and out to device memory even if it may end up being covered up by other objects in the final scene.\\n\\nTBDR skips doing any work that won\\'t be seen, breaking down a scene into tiles before analyzing what needs to be rendered for each. The output is saved temporarily to high speed, low latency Tile Memory. This workflow enables it to better use the entire GPU because it can perform vertex and fragment asynchronously. Apple notes: \"the vertex stage usually makes heavy use of fixed function hardware, whereas the fragment stage uses math and bandwidth. Completely overlapping them allows the device to use all the hardware blocks on the GPU simultaneously.\"\\n\\nAs a technique, TBDR is closely associated with Imagination\\'s PowerVR, which developed in parallel to desktop GPUs on a road less traveled, then emerged around the launch of the first iPhone as the perfect mobile-optimized GPU architecture, with efficiency advantages scaled down PC GPUs couldn\\'t rival.\\n\\nBut while Imagination initially complained that Apple hadn\\'t \\'proven that it wasn\\'t infringing\\' its IP this spring, it does not now appear to be continuing any claim that Apple\\'s new GPU uses any unlicensed PowerVR technology, and instead sold itself off at a huge discount after losing Apple\\'s business.\\n\\nAdditionally, TBDR isn\\'t an approach that is completely unique to Imagination, although there have only ever been a few successful GPU architectures (among the many experimental approaches that have failed). This is similar to the CPU world--currently dominated by ARM in mobile devices and Intel\\'s x86 in PCs and servers--despite many failed attempts to disrupt the status quo by competitors (and even Intel itself).\\n\\nApple\\'s Metal 2 now exposes the details of TBDR to developers for its A11 Bionic GPU so they can further optimize memory use and to \"provide finer-grained synchronization to keep more work on the GPU.\" The company also states that its new GPU \"delivers several features that significantly enhance TBDR,\" allowing third-party apps and games to \"realize new levels of performance and capability.\" Creating an entirely new GPU architecture \"wasn\\'t innovative enough,\" so A11 Bionic also features an entirely new Neural Engine within its Image Signal Processor, tuned to solve very specific problems such as matching, analyzing and calculating thousands of reference points within a flood of image data rushing from the camera sensor.\\n\\nThose tasks could be sent to the GPU, but having logic optimized specifically for matrix multiplications and floating-point processing allows the Neural Engine to excel at those tasks.\\n\\nThe Neural Engine itself has two parallel cores designed to handle real-time processing, capable of performing 600 billion operations per second. That means in addition to applying sophisticated effects to a photo, as Apple has been doing in previous generations of its ISP, it can now perform effects on live video. Beyond effects, this also appears to be what enables the camera system to identify objects and their composition in a scene, allowing it to track and focus on the subject you are filming.\\n\\nThis Neural Engine is credited with giving the A11 Bionic its name. \"Bionic\" generally refers to a human having electromechanical enhancements, and suggests the idea of superhuman abilities due to those enhancements. One could think of A11 Bionic being the opposite of this, as it is actually a machine enhanced with human-like capabilities. Alternatively, you could think of the chip as a bionic enhancement of the human using it, allowing the user to leap over tasks ordinary Androids can\\'t. The third chunk of the A11 Bionic is Apple\\'s original custom implementation of ARM Architecture CPU cores. Apple delivered its original customized A4 SoC back in 2010, and has rapidly iterated on its design. In 2013 it created A7, first 64-bit ARM chip, sending chip rivals into a tailspin.\\n\\nLast year\\'s A10 Fusion got its name from a new architecture that managed tasks between a pair of performance cores and a pair of efficiency cores, enabling flexibility between running at full power and at an efficient idle.\\n\\nThis year, Apple is touting its \"second-generation performance controller,\" designed to scale tasks across more low-power cores, or to surge the workflow to its even faster high-power cores--or even light up the entire 6 core CPU in bursts. Using asymmetric multiprocessing, the A11 Bionic can ramp up to activate any number of cores individually, in proportion to the task at hand.Using asymmetric multiprocessing, the A11 Bionic can ramp up to activate any number of cores individually, in proportion to the task at hand\\n\\nScaling a queue of incoming tasks across multiple cores requires more than just multiple cores on the SoC; apps and OS features have to be designed to take advantage of those multiple cores. That\\'s something Apple has been working on at the OS level--and with its third developers--for years before the iPhone even existed.\\n\\nApple has detailed its software OS strategies oriented around turning off unnecessary processor units and efficiently ordering processes to so they can be scheduled to run as quickly and efficiently as possible. It\\'s now implementing those same kinds of practices in silicon hardware. Other mobile device makers, including Samsung and LG, have never needed to develop their own PC OS platforms.\\n\\nGoogle, which adapted Android from its origins as portable (JavaME) mobile platform, isn\\'t selling it to users who pay for performance. It has no real tablet or desktop computing business, and its phone platform is aimed at hitting an average selling price of less than $300--Android One phones have an aggressive price target of $100. Android buyers are an audience for advertisers, not customers demanding UI polish, app performance or sophisticated features like multiprocessing support. Android apps are optimized to deliver ads.\\n\\nApple states that the two performance-optimized general-purpose CPU cores of the A11 Bionic are up to 25 percent faster than those in last year\\'s A10 Fusion; even larger gains come from its efficiency cores, which have doubled in number to four, and are now up to 70 percent faster.\\n\\nIn Geekbench tests comparing the similarly specced iPhone 7 to iPhone 8 (they share the same RAM and same display resolution), the A11 Bionic scored 25 percent faster in single core and 80 percent faster in multicore scores.\\n\\nThis is particularly noteworthy because Apple\\'s latest chip also delivers its new Neural Engine, GPU, camera ISP and other capabilities that are above and beyond what a generic processor benchmark effectively measures.\\n\\nIn stark contrast, Samsung has for years been marketing \"octa-core\" processors that are actually slower in per-core performance and run an OS that isn\\'t optimized to take effective advantage of multiple cores in apps outside of benchmarks. Google itself once even bragged up its poorly built Nexus 7 at launch as having \"basically 16 cores,\" (the sum of its CPU and GPU cores) a purely false, meaningless marketing claim that didn\\'t make it any faster. It was actually not speedy to begin with and rapidly lost performance over time.\\n\\nRather than excessively bragging about its quantities of abstract technical specifications, Apple\\'s marketing focuses on real-world applications, noting, for example, that the A11 Bionic is \"optimized for amazing 3D games and AR experiences,\" claims that can be experienced every day by App Store visitors.\\n\\nSeparate from the CPU, Apple also designed the Secure Enclave in A7 to handle storage of sensitive data (fingerprint biometrics) in silicon walled off the rest of the system. Apple said it made improvements in the A11 Bionic, but didn\\'t discuss what these involved.\\n\\nThere are also other specialized features of the A11 Bionic, including its super speedy SSD storage controller with custom ECC (error-correcting code) algorithms, as Johny Srouji, Apple\\'s senior vice president of Hardware Technologies, detailed in an interview with Mashable. This isn\\'t just for speed. \"When the user buys the device,\" Srouji noted, \"the endurance and performance of our storage is going to be consistent across the product.\"\\n\\nIn other words, data stored on the device (documents, apps, photos) is better protected from corruption and storage failure (as SSD cells wear out, literally), lowering the prospect of losing your memories and documents, and the frustration of having a device that mysteriously gets slower as time wears on. That\\'s a common problem with many Android devices.\\n\\nApple first introduced its own custom NVMe SSD storage controller for 2015 MacBooks, enabling it to optimize the hardware side of reading and writing from Solid State Storage (ie chips, rather than spinning hard drives).\\n\\nThe company then brought that technology to its iOS devices within the A9, starting with iPhone 6s. NVMe was originally created with the enterprise market in mind, rather than consumer electronics. There are no off the shelf solutions for adding an NVMe controller to a phone, and there are cheaper existing (albeit archaic) protocols to access SSD storage. Apple built and wrote its own.\\n\\nA11 Fusion delivers what is apparently Apple\\'s third-generation iOS storage controller. What\\'s more interesting is that Apple didn\\'t even talk about this on stage, because it had too much else to talk about that was even sexier.\\n\\nTwo years ago, Apple\\'s A9 introduced a hardware-based HEVC decoder, enabling devices to efficiently play back H.265 / \"High Efficiency\" video content. Last year\\'s A10 Fusion introduced a hardware encoder, enabling iPhone 7 to create and save content in the format. The advantage with these High Efficiency formats is that they greatly reduce the space taken up by high-resolution photos and video\\n\\nThe new feature was made available in iOS 11, and is exposed as a preference in Camera Settings for \"High Efficiency camera capture.\" When turned on, photos are compressed using HEIF (High Efficiency Image Format) and video is recorded using HEVC (High Efficiency Video Codec).\\n\\nThe advantage with these High Efficiency formats is that they greatly reduce the space taken up by high-resolution photos and video.\\n\\nApple states that a minute-long 4K 30fps video recorded in the new HEVC format will be about 170MB, while the same thing using the previous H.264 would be 350MB--more than twice as large.\\n\\nTo play this HEVC content back a device needs to be able to decode it. iOS devices earlier than A9 can decode in software, but this takes longer and has a larger hit on the battery than having efficient, dedicated hardware decoding.\\n\\nHEIF video can be transcoded to H.264 (which takes conversion time), or users can also default to \"Most Compatible,\" which continues to save photos as JPG and videos in H.264. However this disables the new video recording options for capturing 4K video at 60fps (as well as the 24fps cinematic setting new to A11 Bionic iPhones).\\n\\nIt is interesting that Apple developed its own video encoder for the A11 Bionic, and also that it made this fact public. In the past, Apple has used off-the-shelf components in its iPods and other devices that incorporated support for a variety of proprietary audio and video codecs, including Microsoft\\'s WMA, WMV and VC-1. Apple didn\\'t activate this capability, preferring instead to use industry standards developed by MPEG LA partners.\\n\\nIt\\'s not clear if Microsoft got licensing royalties from the Windows Media IP on the chips Apple bought, but the larger issue was that Apple had to pay for components with stuff it didn\\'t want to use. By building its own video encoder, it can optimize for only the formats it supports, rather than the generic package of codecs its chip providers select.\\n\\nGoogle\\'s YouTube initially partnered with Apple to provide H.264 video content to iOS users. But the company has since tried to advance its own VP8 and VP9 codecs acquired from On2. While it continues to send H.264 video to iOS users, it is not publishing its higher resolution 4K YouTube content in H.264 or the new H.265/HEVC, which makes YouTube 4K unavailable to Safari users on the web.\\n\\nThis has also created the narrative that Apple TV 4K \"can\\'t play YouTube 4K content,\" when in reality it is Google that is refusing to provide the content Apple TV 4K is designed to decode. It remains to be seen how that will work out, and whether Google will also refuse to support 4K on iOS devices going forward.\\n\\nHaving an efficient, optimized HEVC encoder on iPhone 7, 8 and X (along with iPad, Apple TV and recent generations of Intel Core processors used in Macs) means that users will be able to store far more photos and videos--generally the largest storage hog--in less space. It would also conceivably reduce wear on SSD storage, because there\\'s half as much to write out, move around and subsequently erase.\\n\\nHowever, another thing that HEVC makes possible is recording higher frame rate content. iPhone 8 and X can now enable capture of 4K video at 60fps, for smoother camera pans. Existing 4K video on iPhone 7 is sharply detailed, but if your camera or the subject moves too quickly, it can have a jittery effect. With smooth 60fps capture, videos look a lot better.\\n\\nHowever, that\\'s twice as many frames, meaning that without more advanced compression, a minute of video would consume about 800MB. Using HEVC, the end video is comparable in size to 4K 30fps capture. Note that 60fps video in HEVC requires significant processing power or a dedicated hardware decoder to play. Older Macs already have trouble playing existing 4K clips from iPhone 7.\\n\\nOne of the remaining interesting facets of the A11 Bionic is that if you stack together the parts of the chip that Apple detailed, there\\'s a whole lot of surface area on it that remains completely mysterious.',\n",

       "    'title': \"Why Amazon got out of the Apple App Store tax, and why other developers won't\",\n",
       "    'body': 'Apple and Amazon very, very quietly unveiled a monumental app deal this week, without fanfare or, sadly, much in the way of transparency. Out of nowhere, buttons to buy or rent movies appeared in the Amazon Prime Video app. It\\'s difficult to express how strange this is: for over a decade, Apple has stuck to the rule that all digital goods sold in iOS apps must use Apple\\'s payment methods, including Apple\\'s 30 percent cut.\\n\\nSuddenly, that rule appears to apply to all developers except those who have the leverage to cut a special deal with Apple. That\\'s the most damning way of putting it and the truth is perhaps a bit more nuanced. But if you wanted to cast that nuance aside and rail against metaphorical smoke-filled rooms where giant companies cut deals that aren\\'t offered to anybody else, well, I wouldn\\'t argue with you too much.\\n\\nI want to get into some of the details here -- much of which is based more on reasonable assumption than confirmed information (see the note about transparency above). I think it\\'s interesting in its own right, but I also think it\\'s important context for the real question: what does this mean for everybody else in the App Store ecosystem? (I\\'ll disclose here that my wife works for Oculus on its app store, but I recuse myself from reporting on it so I have literally no idea what Oculus\\' policies are.)\\n\\nApple provided us with a statement about the change. You may have read it already, but there\\'s enough detail in the wording to give us a fuller picture of what\\'s really going on. (An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the change and some of the features without giving a formal comment.)\\n\\nHere\\'s Apple:\\n\\nApple has an established program for premium subscription video entertainment providers to offer a variety of customer benefits -- including integration with the Apple TV app, AirPlay 2 support, tvOS apps, universal search, Siri support and, where applicable, single or zero sign-on. On qualifying premium video entertainment apps such as Prime Video, Altice One and Canal+, customers have the option to buy or rent movies and TV shows using the payment method tied to their existing video subscription.\\n\\nThere is quite a lot to unpack here.\\n\\nFirstly, I just want to point out that Apple calls this an \"established program,\" one that already applied to those smaller cable companies. But it was completely new news to me and also to longtime Apple reporter Mark Gurman, who definitely would have remembered such a thing!\\n\\nAnyway, you can suss out the outlines of the deal that was struck. Amazon gets buy buttons inside its app for current Prime Video subscribers, Apple gets Amazon\\'s complete and total participation in the Apple TV features it cares about the most. Instead of just being yet another icon in the home screen grid, Amazon\\'s services are now deeply integrated into the user experiences Apple wants to move everybody towards.\\n\\nNilay Patel made this point quite strongly in today\\'s Vergecast podcast -- give it a listen. Apple has long wanted to make the TV app the primary interface on the Apple TV box, but it needs more services to integrate into that UI.\\n\\nApple also very much wants to get consumers to sign up for other channels like HBO or Cinemax through its Apple TV app. And that\\'s where the second Amazon concession comes in.\\n\\nOver at Daring Fireball, John Gruber did the work of punching the subscribe and pay buttons on all the possible permutations of subscribing to Amazon Prime Video in and out of Apple\\'s TV app. What he discovered is something that isn\\'t mentioned in Apple\\'s statement: if you\\'re not already a Prime Video subscriber, the sign-up flow in Amazon\\'s app ends up getting routed through Apple\\'s payment system.\\n\\nThere are some hidden caveat words at the very end of the statement. I\\'ll just emphasize them here: \"customers have the option to buy or rent movies and TV shows using the payment method tied to their existing video subscription.\"\\n\\nWhich means that Apple is getting a cut of the new subscriptions that start in Amazon\\'s app. Perhaps it\\'s the standard 30 percent in the first year, 15 percent after that. Perhaps it\\'s something better. Bottom line, new customers have their payments routed through Apple, existing Prime customers don\\'t.\\n\\nAll of the above is why I\\'m comfortable saying that Amazon had leverage on Apple: Apple has clear incentives in the form of getting more participation in the Apple TV app and in getting a cut on the new subscribers it drives to Amazon. Amazon has the incentive of not paying more money to Apple.\\n\\nMost of all, you can tell it\\'s about leverage simply because the Amazon Kindle app hasn\\'t changed. You can\\'t buy a Kindle book directly in the Kindle app, nor is Amazon even allowed to link to or even hint at the possibility that it has a whole damn Kindle store on its website where you can make one-click purchases.\\n\\nLast but certainly not least, let us turn our attention to my favorite part of Apple\\'s statement, the one that defines what kind of companies are apparently able to get this sweetheart deal: \"premium subscription video entertainment providers.\"\\n\\nLast time I checked, Netflix is a \"premium subscription video entertainment provider.\" Also, last time I checked it had zero interest in giving up its own UI just to have its shows mixed in with everybody else\\'s in the Apple TV app. Actually, I haven\\'t technically checked -- but Nick Statt is doing so with Netflix and a whole host of other companies as I write these words. Keep an eye out for his report.\\n\\nTake that phrase and add the word \"games\" to it and you\\'re pretty much describing Fortnite. Epic\\'s CEO Tim Sweeney has been incredibly outspoken about App Store taxes. He\\'s taken Fortnite off the Google Play Store and would dearly love to find a way to not have to give Apple a cut on iOS devices. Does he have a personal stake in that fight? Obviously. But he\\'s also one of a growing chorus of voices pushing back against the so-called \"Apple Tax.\"\\n\\nWhen the Amazon news hit, the very first thing I wrote in our Slack was \"Tim Sweeney is going to lose his shit.\" Sweeney did not, but he did post a \"congratulations\" tweet so thick with schadenfreude you could wedge a Fortnite pickaxe into it.\\n\\nEpic is not the only company pushing back against Apple\\'s App Store fees. Spotify has filed a formal antitrust complaint in the European Union. Apple\\'s pushback is that fewer than 0.5 percent of Spotify users are charged Apple\\'s 15-percent fee, but that argument disingenuously leaves out the fact that Spotify hasn\\'t offered a direct way to subscribe in its iOS app since 2016.\\n\\nI recently rewatched the House Judiciary\\'s July 2019 hearing on \"Online platforms and entrepreneurship\" on C-Span (how I choose to spend my self-isolation is my business). In it, Apple\\'s corporate law & chief compliance officer Kyle Andeer repeated the claim about Spotify. He also pointed out that 84 percent of apps in the App Store pay nothing to Apple because they\\'re free and that a decade ago, app developers were paying quite a bit more than 30% to retail stores for the physical distribution of their goods. (The relevant question from Rep Jamie Raskin starts about 90 minutes in.)\\n\\nAll of these arguments are old hat. And though the Netflixes, Fortnites, and Spotifys of the world are surely vexed by Apple\\'s policies, I think that for many smaller developers the 30-percent fee is simply not at the top of their list of concerns. Higher priorities likely include prices being driven down, market dynamics being corrupted by free-to-play games, upgrades made difficult because of limited pricing models, review-bombing over subscription fees, and just making payroll.\\n\\nIf there\\'s a moral and rhetorical force behind my opening line about smoke-filled rooms, it\\'s this: developing mobile apps is hard and succeeding is even harder, but at least you could tell yourself that even gigantic companies like Amazon have to deal with the same rules you do. The question is whether Apple needs to be held to a standard of fairness and transparency for the app ecosystem it fully controls on iOS or not.\\n\\nBecause Apple has such strict control over what apps can appear on iOS, it bears a higher burden of responsibility to treat iOS developers fairly and consistently. Note I didn\\'t say \"equally,\" because it\\'s unrealistic to expect that a first-time dev could get the same accommodations as massive companies.\\n\\nBut if the rule is you pay Apple a 30-percent cut of your app\\'s cost unless Apple really needs something from you to bolster its own subscription business, that\\'s neither fair nor consistent. I asked Apple if there was something other developers could do to qualify for a deal that\\'s similar to what Amazon now has. The company referred me to its original statement.\\n\\nBig news in laptop land: Intel and Nvidia dropped their new stuff on the world. I\\'m particularly interested to see how Intel\\'s 10th Gen chips stack up against AMD. Sadly, \"10th Gen\" isn\\'t a very descriptive term these days, what with the 10nm vs 14nm models and other complications in the roadmap. The chips we\\'re looking at today are for gaming laptops, mainly.\\n\\nAnd so, there are also a handful of new gaming laptops. My favorite, in case you\\'re wondering, is Asus\\'. It\\'s not only a member of the Keyboard In The Front Club, I think it is now the president. It was voted into office by unanimous consent after showing that its bottom screen flips up. It\\'s ridiculous and I love it.\\n\\n┏ Intel\\'s new 10th Gen chips bring 5.0GHz clock speeds to gaming laptops.\\n\\n┏ Nvidia\\'s RTX Super GPUs for laptops have arrived -- here\\'s where you\\'ll see them first.\\n\\n┏ MSI announces new laptops with Comet Lake H and new Nvidia GPUs.\\n\\n┏ Razer\\'s new Blade 15 has powerful specs and an improved keyboard.\\n\\n┏ Gigabyte\\'s latest gaming laptop supports Intel\\'s most powerful 10th Gen Core i9 processor yet.\\n\\n┏ Asus\\' ROG Zephyrus Duo 15 is a gaming laptop with two screens.\\n\\nA little more than a week ago, Casey Newton called for a daily coronavirus briefing from Amazon. I agreed then and agree even more now, if only because it would be a forcing function for senior executives to present a coherent response strategy,\\n\\nMore than many companies, Amazon can make the case that it\\'s an essential businesses. And yet for all of the thinking, effort, robotics, and software that has gone into its warehouse logistics, precious little of that disciplined, organized approach is apparent in its efforts to protect the workers in those warehouses.\\n\\nYesterday, it belatedly did the right thing by pledging to provide temperature checks and masks in all warehouses. I also applaud the decision to stop selling N95 and surgical masks to the public and even the virtual SXSW film festival.\\n\\nBut at the same time, Amazon\\'s general counsel privately insulted a warehouse worker that had been fired. Amazon contends he had broken social distancing rules, but that doesn\\'t excuse the memo in the slightest. And then, as is his wont, Amazon SVP Jay Carney popped off on Twitter with the following, easily one of the top five self-owns in the history of corporate PR:\\n\\nIndeed.\\n\\nMeanwhile, though this next story isn\\'t technically, it\\'s certainly related. Jeff Bezos\\' space company is pressuring employees to launch a tourist rocket during the pandemic. Loren Grush has the inside story on what\\'s going on at Blue Origin and their attitude to the pandemic seems really shortsighted to me. Which is ironic, given the company\\'s long-term vision of securing the future of humanity.\\n\\nIn a meeting with the New Shepard team on Wednesday, April 1st, Blue Origin leadership talked about ways to do a trip to Van Horn with a smaller group than usual and suggested that employees should keep a low profile while in town, according to a recording provided to The Verge. In the meeting, numerous employees voiced concerns about the trip, and one manager said there may be employment repercussions if they didn\\'t agree with management\\'s decisions.\\n\\n\"I would say that you should ask yourself, as an individual, are you acting as a toxin in the organization, fanning discontent, or are you really trying to help our senior leaders make better decisions?\" Jeff Ashby, a senior mission assurance director at Blue Origin and a former NASA astronaut, said to employees during the meeting.\\n\\n┏ Zoom freezes features to focus on security and privacy for its 200 million daily users.

       "    'title': \"The iPad's evolution through the years: From being a tablet to a computer\",\n",
       "    'body': 'Over the last decade, Apple has transformed the iPad into a personal computer. Here\\'s a look at how the iPad has changed over the past 10 years.\\n\\nOn January 27, 2010, Steve Jobs took the stage at a special Apple event. On display was the first iPad. Designed by the team of Jony Ive, the iPad was a giant step in creating \"a third category of device, something between a laptop and a smartphone.\" However, skeptics criticised Apple for creating the iPad. Some called the iPad a big iPod Touch, others said the device would fail miserably. But Apple proved the entire industry and the critics wrong with the iPad.\\n\\nFast forward to 2020, the iPad is the most popular media consumption device. With each newer generation, the iPad has got an upgrade and gained new features and capabilities. While the first iPad was more or less seen as a media consumption tablet, the newer models are as good as regular laptops in terms of features and performance.\\n\\nApple has, in fact, taking a new direction with the iPad. With iPadOS, the iPad is on a path of becoming your primary computer. With the launch of the new iPad Pro, it\\'s time to look back at the evolution of the iPad.\\n\\niPad (1st generation)\\n\\nAnnounced: Jan 27, 2010\\n\\nAvailable: April 3. 2010\\n\\nKey features: 9.7-inch 1024×768 display;1GHz A4 chip; 10-hour battery\\n\\nPrice: $499\\n\\nThe original iPad has a special place in the tech world. Being the first iPad, there are a lot of fond memories attached to the first iPad. Launched on April 3, 2010, the original iPad was a big slab of glass that was made for browsing the web, playing games, reading eBooks and watching videos. It featured the same user interface and operating system as the iPod Touch and iPhone, including the 3-axis accelerometer that enables the tablet to detect when it is being moved or tilted. Approximately 300,000 iPads were sold on day one, according to Apple.\\n\\niPad 2 (2nd generation)\\n\\nAnnounced: March 2, 2011\\n\\nAvailable: March 11, 2011\\n\\nKey features: Thinner and lighter; improved performance; camera for video recording\\n\\nPrice: $499\\n\\nThe iPad 2 was a major improvement over the original iPad. It featured the dual-core Apple A5 processor, which brought significant processing capability. It also included a more powerful graphics processor. The iPad 2 was also thinner and lighter than the original iPad. Most importantly, the iPad 2 got front and back cameras for video recording. For the first time, Apple brought the FaceTime application on the iPad, allowing users to make video calls with other iPhone/iPod Touch users. The iPad 2 also came with an optical smart cover.\\n\\niPad (3rd generation)\\n\\nAnnounced: March 7, 2012\\n\\nAvailable: March 16, 2012\\n\\nKey features: 4G support; Retina display\\n\\nPrice: $499\\n\\nThe third-generation iPad came with the Retina Display, making the highest resolution display for a tablet at the time of launch. It featured the same processor as the iPad 2 with better graphics. Although the iPad 3 was thicker and slightly heavier than its predecessor, the device was surely an improvement on many fronts. For instance, iPad 3 became the first iPad to feature 4G connectivity. It also got a 5MP camera.\\n\\nExpress Tech is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@expresstechnology) and stay updated with the latest tech news\\n\\niPad Mini (1st generation)\\n\\nAnnounced: October 23, 2012\\n\\nAvailable: November 2, 2012\\n\\nKey features: Compact and lighter than the regular iPad;4G capability\\n\\nPrice: $329\\n\\nFor the first time ever, Apple introduced a mini version of the iPad. The 7.9-inch iPad was a slimmed-down version of the iPad but offered the same features as the regular iPad, including dual-facing cameras and 4G support. Although Apple never made a distinction between the regular iPad and iPad Mini, the latter proved to be more popular among ladies and kids, thanks to better portability and small screen size. At $329, the iPad Mini was the cheapest iPad in Apple\\'s iPad lineup.\\n\\niPad (4th generation)\\n\\nAnnounced: October 23, 2012\\n\\nAvailable: November 5, 2012\\n\\nKey features: A better processor; 4G support; 128GB storage option\\n\\nPrice: $499\\n\\nThe iPad 4 wasn\\'t a significant update over the iPad 3. It offered the same features as the iPad, including a Retina Display and 4G support but came with a more powerful A6 processor and up to 128GB of internal storage.\\n\\niPad Mini (2nd generation)\\n\\nAnnounced: October 22, 2013\\n\\nAvailable: November 12, 2013\\n\\nKey features: Retina display; A7 processor\\n\\nPrice: $399\\n\\nWhen the original iPad Mini, many found the tablet underpowered. With the iPad Mini 2, Apple tried to address those concerns by adding a Retina Display and an A7 processor. But these features increased the cost of the iPad Mini 2. Unlike the iPad Mini which was sold for $329, the new iPad Mini started at $399 for the base model.\\n\\niPad Air\\n\\nAnnounced: October 22, 2013\\n\\nAvailable: November 1, 2013\\n\\nKey features: Thinner and lighter; A7 processor\\n\\nPrice: $499\\n\\nThe iPad Air was way better than any previous-generation iPad. Not only was it twice as powerful as its predecessor, but the tablet was also lighter and slimmer as well. The iPad Air was the first iPad to feature a 64-bit processor. Not many remember this, but the iPad Air was the first to feature dual microphones that offered noise cancellation for better audio while recording videos.\\n\\niPad Mini (3rd generation)\\n\\nAnnounced: October 16, 2014\\n\\nAvailable: October 22, 2014\\n\\nKey features: Touch ID fingerprint sensor; Apple Pay\\n\\nPrice: $399\\n\\nThe iPad Mini 3 offered the Touch ID fingerprint sensor and Apple Pay for the first time. However, the iPad Mini didn\\'t offer any performance boost over the previous model. The tablet featured the A7 chip and the Retina Display. It was an underwhelming upgrade over the iPad Mini 2.\\n\\niPad Air 2\\n\\nAnnounced: October 16, 2014\\n\\nAvailable: October 22, 2014\\n\\nKey features: Thin and light; improved screen;\\n\\nPrice: $499\\n\\nThe iPad Air 2 was a lot different from any previous-generation iPad. While it retained the design language from the iPad Air, but it was a lot slimmer and lighter. The tablet had a very powerful processor (A8X, to be precise), and was the first iPad multi-carrier SIM connection. The iPad Air 2 shipped with iOS 9, which introduced split-screen.\\n\\niPad Pro (1st generation)\\n\\nAnnounced: September 9, 2015\\n\\nAvailable: November 11, 2015\\n\\nKey features: 12.9-inch screen; Apple Pencil support\\n\\nPrice: $799\\n\\nWith the iPad Pro, Apple took the first step to break the image of the iPad as a consumption-only device. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro was a giant tablet, darwfing the 9.7-inch iPad Air 2. But the size wasn\\'t the highlight of the iPad Pro. It featured the A9X processor, and Apple made a lot of doldrums over the iPad Pro\\'s fast performance. The 12.9-inch Pro was also the first iPad to support Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard. The iPad Pro had four stereo speakers more than any other iPad.\\n\\niPad Mini 4\\n\\nAnnounced: September 9, 2015\\n\\nAvailable: September 9, 2015\\n\\nKey features: Improved cameras; A8 chipset\\n\\nPrice: $399\\n\\nThe iPad Mini 4 was introduced alongside the iPad Pro in 2015. The new version of the iPad Mini had the same features as the iPad Air 2, including all the multitasking features. The Mini 4 also featured a redesigned chassis that was thinner, lighter and slightly taller. Unfortunately, the iPad Mini 4 was completely overshadowed by the iPad Pro during Apple\\'s launch event.\\n\\n9.7-inch iPad Pro\\n\\nAnnounced: March 21, 2016\\n\\nAvailable: March 24, 2016\\n\\nKey features: True Tone display; 12MP camera\\n\\nPrice: $599\\n\\nThe 9.7-inch iPad Pro was more aligned to Apple\\'s goal of making the iPad a laptop replacement. The 9.7-inch iPad Pro featured many of the same features as the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, including the A9X chipset, four stereo speakers, Apple Pencil support, and Smart keyboard. It also came with a new 12MP camera for shooting Live Photos and 4K video.\\n\\niPad (5th generation)\\n\\nAnnounced: March 21, 2017\\n\\nAvailable: March 27, 2017\\n\\nKey features: Affordable price tag\\n\\nPrice: $329\\n\\nWhile Apple continued to push the Pro lineup at the high-end, the company didn\\'t forget to update the entry-level iPad. The iPad (5th generation) was Apple\\'s least expensive full-size iPad with a big enough screen, the capable processor inside and 10 hours of battery life. The fifth-generation iPad was targeted at schools.\\n\\niPad Pro (2nd generation)\\n\\nAnnounced: June 5, 2017\\n\\nAvailable: Mid-June, 2017\\n\\nKey features: 120Hz display;\\n\\nPrice: $649/$799\\n\\nThe second-generation iPad Pro, available in 12.9-inch and 10.5-inch screen sizes, was more close to replacing the laptop. The new iPad Pro was the first iPad to support HDR video, a feature typically reserved for high-end TVs. It also featured a True Tone Display that adjusts its brightness and tone depending on your environment. Its AX10x processor offered faster performance and improved graphics performance, making it adequate to run high-performance games and apps. It also supported Apple\\'s Smart Keyboard accessory and the Apple Pencil.\\n\\nThe iPad Pro shipped with iOS 11, which included many new features such as file browser for searching for files, a dock at the bottom that allows you to keep more icons on the screen at once, drag and drop features, multi-tasking with multi-windows and more.\\n\\niPad (6th generation)\\n\\nAnnounced: March 27, 2018\\n\\nAvailable: March 27, 2018\\n\\nKey features: Apple Pencil support; A10 processor\\n\\nPrice: $329\\n\\nThe entry-level 9.7-inch iPad finally gained the ability to use Apple Pencil, which was earlier limited to the iPad Pro. Plus, the sixth-generation iPad also featured the A10 processor. Thanks to the Apple Pencil support, the iPad (6th generation) was aimed at students or anyone who wants to use the iPad for work and pleasure.\\n\\niPad Pro (3rd generation)\\n\\nAnnounced: October 30, 2018\\n\\nAvailable: November 7, 2018\\n\\nKey features: A12X processor; New design; Liquid Retina Display; FaceID\\n\\nPrice: 11-inch, $799/12.9-inch, $999\\n\\nLaunched at Apple\\'s special event in the fall of 2018, the iPad Pro (3rd generation) was designed for professional users. Made available in 11-inch and 12.9-inch options, the iPad Pro looked different from other iPad, featuring thin bezels and a sleeker, cleaner look.\\n\\nInside, the iPad Pro featured a more powerful A12X Bionic chipset that was great for multitasking and running apps like Adobe Photoshop. It was also the first iPad to feature FaceID and a USB Type-C port. The iPad Pro also came with the second-generation Apple Pencil. When launched, the third-generation iPad Pro was the most expensive iPad on the market.\\n\\niPad Mini (5th generation)\\n\\nAnnounced: March 18, 2019\\n\\nAvailable: March 25, 2019\\n\\nKey features: Apple Pencil support; A12 processor\\n\\nPrice: $399\\n\\nThere\\'s an interest in the iPad Mini, and the iPad Mini (5th generation) is a proof. Last year, Apple updated the iPad Mini with a new processor and Apple Pencil support. It has a 7.9-inch screen, an A12 Bionic chipset and 64GB of internal storage. The new Mini also offers first-generation Apple Pencil support. The biggest advantage of buying the iPad Mini is that it\\'s portable and handy to carry, plus the Mini doesn\\'t cost too much. The iPad Mini is highly recommended for journalists or someone who jots down notes in the profession.\\n\\niPad Air (3rd generation)\\n\\nAnnounced: March 18, 2019\\n\\nAvailable: March 25, 2019\\n\\nKey features: Apple Pencil support; Smart Keyboard\\n\\nPrice: $499\\n\\nThe new iPad Air was launched in 2019 and it\\'s the third-generation of the device.

       "    'title': 'Samsung vs. Apple: Inside The Brutal War For Smartphone Dominance - Business Quick Magazine',\n",
       "    'body': 'n 2005, Chang-Gyu Hwang -- president of Samsung\\'s semiconductor and memory business -- traveled with two fellow executives to Palo Alto, to the home of Steve Jobs.\\n\\n\"I met him with the solution to Apple\\'s life-or-death problem hidden deep in my pocket,\" Hwang wrote.\\n\\nIn the course of their meeting, he pulled out the NAND flash memory, as it was called, and put it on the table. He called it \"my trump card.\"\\n\\nHis pitch? Flash memory was a much more lightweight and efficient storage device than the traditional hard disk. And Samsung was one of few companies that could guarantee a rock-solid supply.\\n\\n\"This is exactly what I wanted,\" Jobs said of Samsung\\'s flash memory, according to Hwang. He agreed to make Samsung the sole supplier of flash memory for the iPod.\\n\\n\"It was the moment that marked the beginning of our dominance in the U.S. semiconductor market,\" Hwang wrote. With that, Samsung had a launchpad from which to eventually get into smartphones, when they came out.\\n\\nThey would go from supplier to competitor.\\n\\nJobs was livid when Samsung released its smartphone in 2009. As he told biographer Walter Isaacson, he wanted to launch \"thermonuclear war\" on Android, the operating system used in Samsung phones. Samsung was the Apple iPhone chip supplier that dared to compete directly against Apple by making a similar-looking smartphone, and with the Android operating system, which Jobs abhorred. Jobs was prepared to sue. Tim Cook, as Apple\\'s supply chain expert, was wary of endangering the relationship with a supplier that Apple depended on.\\n\\nWhen Samsung vice chairman Jay Lee -- who was then the company\\'s chief customer officer -- visited the Cupertino campus, Jobs and Cook expressed their concerns to him. Apple drafted a proposal to license some of its patents to Samsung for $30 per smartphone and $40 per tablet, with a 20 percent discount for cross-licensing Samsung\\'s portfolio back to Apple. For 2010 that revenue would have come to $250 million.\\n\\nLeft: Steve Jobs unveils the new iPhone 4 at an Apple conference in June 2010. Right: Chang-Gyu Hwang speaks at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in March 2015.\\n\\nIn the end, Samsung\\'s lawyers reversed the offer. Since Apple was copying Samsung\\'s patents, they argued, Apple had to pay Samsung.\\n\\nIn April 2011, Apple filed multiple lawsuits, spanning dozens of countries, against Samsung for patent infringement. It demanded $2.5 billion in damages. Samsung quickly countersued for infringement of five patents relating to its wireless and data transmission technology.\\n\\nThe war was on.\\n\\nSamsung executives felt Apple was trying to create a monopoly with generic patents like the iPad\\'s black rounded rectangle shape, a patent so silly that a court threw it out. \"We are going to patent it all,\" Jobs once said. He also blatantly mocked Samsung and other competitors, calling their larger phones \"Hummers.\" \"No one\\'s going to buy that,\" he said at a press conference in July 2010.\\n\\nSamsung\\'s management team didn\\'t take Jobs\\' attack lightly.\\n\\n\"I am talking to you on a phone right now that Apple just copied,\" Brian Wallace, Samsung\\'s former vice president for strategic marketing, told me years later. \"I\\'ve got a Note Edge. It\\'s a giant fuckin\\' phone that Steve Jobs made fun of. Who was right? Samsung was right.\"\\n\\nSamsung\\'s greatest strength was its ability to manufacture superior hardware, faster than any of its competitors, through its vast, strict, top-down management system and its superior supply chain.\\n\\nBut the work of the marketers at Samsung was frustratingly subpar.\\n\\nSamsung didn\\'t use people in its commercials -- \"just product and voiceover and talking about the product benefit,\" said Samsung\\'s chief marketing officer, Todd Pendleton. Rather than pitch consumers on why Samsung was great, marketing stories were framed around the telecom carriers -- \"telling a story around their network and why their network is great.\"\\n\\nThe South Korean headquarters, meanwhile, sent over goofy and culturally inappropriate commercials that incited rebellion among the Americans on staff. \"They wanted us to use butterflies,\" said former marketing vice president Clyde Roberson. He called the ads \"Hello Kitty.\"\\n\\n\"I am talking to you on a phone right now that Apple just copied,\" said Brian Wallace, Samsung\\'s former vice president for strategic marketing. \"It\\'s a giant phone that Steve Jobs made fun of. Who was right? Samsung was right.\"\\n\\n\"We need more creativity!\" Dale Sohn, the CEO of Samsung Telecommunications America, the Texas mobile phone office, exclaimed in a meeting in 2010, according to a senior manager who was present. Dale reported to mobile chief J.K. Shin. He had been tasked with turning things around in America, Samsung\\'s toughest market, given the iPhone\\'s huge popularity. \"I want someone who\\'s got tattoos all over his arms and earrings!\"\\n\\nWhen Dale put out a call for a new chief marketing officer, a headhunter zeroed in on Pendleton. Pendleton had been an unconventional marketer at Nike, an impresario and master brand builder. He had been offbeat and irreverent in the ads he crafted and sharp and to the point in the way he communicated.\\n\\nTodd, however, had never worked at a tech company before and didn\\'t know the industry. As a tech specialist, the company reached out to a former BlackBerry digital marketer named Brian Wallace.\\n\\nPendleton and Wallace quickly got to work. The two marketing executives brought aboard thirty-six marketers and treated the office as a black-box operation. \"We had to be somewhat insular to be able to pull some of this stuff off,\" said a team member. They were worried about meddling from South Korea\\'s bureaucracy. Dale provided air cover from headquarters, giving them an unusual degree of latitude and space to get their work done.\\n\\nIn 2011, at Samsung\\'s U.S. headquarters, Pendleton gathered about fifty people into a meeting. He approached the whiteboard and wrote: \"Samsung = ?\"\\n\\n\"Who are we?\" he asked. \"What do we stand for?\" Then he went around the room and asked everyone to fill in their idea. \"I got about 50 different answers,\" he said. For Todd Pendleton, it was alarming. \"If we can\\'t answer [that] as employees, consumers are not going to know who we are.\"\\n\\nOn a chart of competitors in their space, with \"style\" for the vertical and \"innovation\" for the horizontal axis, they placed Apple and Sony in the upper-right quadrant, marking them as both stylish and innovative.\\n\\nSamsung, on the other hand, still lacked brand power: It was raised only slightly on the style axis, while it was far to the left on the innovation axis. In other words, consumers saw Samsung as having little of either. \"Less stylish, less innovative.\" \"More functional.\" \"Good quality and value.\" With Apple and Sony commanding and fiercely protecting that stylish and innovative space, could Samsung find an opening?\\n\\nIn focus groups and surveys, the marketers noticed, there was a growing divide between two camps: those who used Apple\\'s iPhones and those who used smartphones from HTC, Samsung, and Nokia, which ran Google\\'s quickly growing open-source operating system, Android.\\n\\nIf Walls Could Talk: Samsung\\'s headquarters in Mountain View, California.\\n\\n\"Android people consider themselves to be smarter than Apple people,\" a marketer under Todd concluded from his data. In fact, the team had to split up focus groups that included both Apple and Android fans, as they\\'d get particularly raucous and unproductive. There was always at least one Apple fan in the room who scolded the Android fans, and vice versa, with Android users pointing out how much more flexible and customizable their operating system was. \"There was this growing base of Android users who could become a tribe,\" Brian Wallace said, crunching a new trend in the social-media chatter. \"But they needed a leader.\"\\n\\nSamsung wanted to be that leader.\\n\\nPendleton showed his colleagues side-by-side hardware comparisons between the iPhone and the Galaxy phone in The Wall Street Journal, which showed Samsung leading in a number of areas. The problem was that Samsung, up to this point, was not attempting to tell a story. Apple was commanding the narrative: It had the cult of Steve Jobs, a massive following, and glowing media coverage, and it had unleashed a barrage of aggressive legal action arguing that Samsung was a copycat in terms of new products and innovation.\\n\\nCould Samsung reverse the narrative? What if its Android phones were actually the smart person\\'s alternative to the iPhone, and Steve Jobs\\'s worshippers were the mindless followers?\\n\\nThe outcome of the lawsuits -- showing that this or that square, icon, or color wasn\\'t copied -- wasn\\'t the concern of Todd\\'s team. More urgent was the big-picture narrative; that is what built emotional appeal for the customer. The court case was only one aspect of the Samsung war; final victory, they knew, would go to the company that told the best story to the public.\\n\\nBecause Apple was an important Samsung customer, the executives at headquarters were pushing for a cautious approach. They wanted to take down each competitor, from HTC to Motorola to BlackBerry to Apple, one by one over the next five years.\\n\\nDale informed Todd and his team that five years was too long a time period to overtake Apple. He shortened the time frame to two years, on orders from Samsung headquarters. In fact, the team completed their work in eighteen months.\\n\\nBy attacking Apple head-on, Samsung\\'s marketers thought they could establish themselves as the challenger brand, turning the competition with Apple into a Coke-versus-Pepsi war for the smartphone world. But how do you attack Apple without looking petty, without giving it free advertising, without acting like the smaller dog in the pack who barks the loudest and then gets laughed at?\\n\\nThe team turned to a consultant named Joe Crump, senior vice president for strategy and planning at Razorfish, one of the world\\'s largest interactive agencies, to help them convey the depth of the brand problem in America to Samsung\\'s senior executives. Crump had an idea to get that across: He\\'d send camera crews around Times Square, each carrying two duffel bags. The first bag, people on the street would be told, contained the next unreleased iPhone. The other had a Samsung phone.\\n\\n\"What would you give us for each?\"\\n\\nHere was the response to the question when they thought the bag contained the new, unreleased iPhone: \"I\\'d give you my brand new BMW. . . . I\\'d give you ten thousand dollars. . . . I\\'d give you my sister.\" And the response for the Galaxy: \"I don\\'t know. Five bucks?\" One guy offered his half-eaten ice cream cone.\\n\\n\"The Samsung [response] was just blistering,\" Brian recalled. \"We had to even take some of it out because it was just so harsh.\"\\n\\nA visiting delegation of South Korean executives huddled in a conference room to watch the video of these Times Square interactions. They were aghast. Suddenly Pendleton had their ear. The research -- the field testing -- had been done for internal consumption only. It was designed by Pendleton to get the South Korean executives to grasp the size of the problem.\\n\\nStep two was to ensure that the economics of the coming marketing war on Apple made sense. Samsung had built a carrier-driven model, jumping through hoops to ensure that Sprint and AT&T received their own customized Galaxy phones to sell, using Samsung\\'s marketing money. If Todd pulled a maneuver too soon, swarms of customers might show up at AT&T stores -- AT&T was the exclusive carrier for the iPhone at the time -- only to have the advertising throughout the stores nudge them toward Apple.\\n\\nThe solution? To redirect Samsung\\'s marketing budget. At the time, Samsung was putting about 70 percent of its U.S. smartphone budget in so-called marketing development funds (MDFs), which were cash piles allocated to the carriers for advertising and rebates. About 30 percent of the budget went to Samsung\\'s own branding efforts. Pendleton\\'s team convinced Dale Sohn to reverse the figures: to put 70 percent behind Samsung\\'s own efforts and devote 30 percent to the carriers.\\n\\nWhat would you give for the new, unreleased iPhone? \"I\\'d give you my brand new BMW. . . . I\\'d give you ten thousand dollars. . . . I\\'d give you my sister.\" And the response for the Galaxy? \"I don\\'t know. Five bucks?\"\\n\\nOnce Samsung had the marketing budget to reach out directly to customers, Pendleton could initiate step three: hiring an ad agency. He annoyed Samsung headquarters by going around their established Madison Avenue and Seoul agencies and instead putting in a call to relative newcomer 72andSunny, a boutique advertising firm with offices in Los Angeles, New York, and Amsterdam that had a special zing for cultural marketing.\\n\\nTodd\\'s team chose 72andSunny specifically for its edginess. On a conference call with 72andSunny, he laid out Samsung\\'s goal, as handed down by Dale Sohn.\\n\\n\"I expect us to be number one in a couple years.\"\\n\\nThe creative executives at 72andSunny got to work and churned out their first approach for Pendleton, who was present at the shoots and the editing, eager to maintain his creative hand. In one early version of a commercial, two characters waiting in line outside an Apple store had a conversation about the features and quality of their Apple and Samsung phones, followed by a cut to another scene of two characters talking about their phones.\\n\\nIt was slow, boring, and dull. Samsung\\'s bid to take on Apple, Todd\\'s team feared, would be finished before it had even started.\\n\\n\"We don\\'t have a campaign here, guys,\" Pendleton said.\\n\\nWith the holiday shopping season closing in, the only solution was to chop up and redo the film then and there. During a frantic all-nighter, someone in the room suggested that they turn the commercial into a single scene, rather than two separate, awkward, forced moments of chatter between disparate characters.\\n\\nThe new commercial was completed the next afternoon.\\n\\nIt started, as before, with a line of apparent Apple lemmings waiting all night around a street corner for the release of the next big iThing -- presumably an iPhone, though Apple was never mentioned by name.\\n\\n\"Guys, I\\'m so amped I can stay here for three weeks,\" says an apparent Apple idolater.\\n\\nNo longer was the smartphone war a battle between Apple and a tangle of obscure Android me-too phones. Now it was a two-horse race. Everyone else had fallen by the wayside.\\n\\nThen another pedestrian hails a taxi on the sidewalk, holding the mystery device.\\n\\n\"Hey, bro, can we see your phone?\" The mob of Apple fans snatch the device and pore over its hardware and features. \"It\\'s a Samsung Galaxy,\" the pedestrian tells them. \"Check out the screen on this thing -- it\\'s huge.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s a Galaxy S II. This phone is amazing,\" says the Samsung guy, showing off his smartphone before getting into a taxi, bidding farewell to the crowd of Apple zombies.\\n\\nThe message? You don\\'t need to wait in line. You don\\'t need to follow the hype.\\n\\n\"The Next Big Thing Is Already Here,\" the commercial finishes.\\n\\n\"God damn!\" Todd exclaimed after looking at it. \"We\\'ve got a campaign!\"\\n\\nPendleton\\'s staff sent the commercial to South Korea for approval. Five days later, they\\'d still heard nothing back. At six o\\'clock on day five, Dale Sohn stood up, put on his jacket, and got ready to go home, before leaving a word of advice on the silence from Seoul.\\n\\n\"It means they\\'ve given you enough rope to hang yourself,\" Sohn said.\\n\\nIt was up to Todd\\'s team to make the leap and take the risk. And if it failed, they\\'d have to answer for it.\\n\\nThey proceeded to leak the film to the popular tech and culture website Mashable, which unveiled it on November 22, 2011, before Samsung posted it \"officially\" on its Facebook page later that day. Pendleton was abandoning the marketing world\\'s older, more vanilla strategy of going through print and TV news outlets, opting for the Web first, appealing to millennials. Then, on Thanksgiving weekend, the commercial debuted in minute-long spots during the NFL games.\\n\\nThe campaign was a phenomenal success, beyond anything the team had anticipated; Samsung had hit precisely the sweet spot, with viewers responding that they were tired of swallowing what they thought was Apple\\'s unjustified pretentiousness. The commercial transformed Samsung Telecommunications America into one of the fastest-growing brands on Facebook, with more than 26 million fans in sixteen months.\\n\\n\"We are the fastest-growing brand globally on Twitter, with almost two million followers,\" Pendleton later recounted at a press conference.\\n\\n\"Get ready to take out your designer pitchforks, Macheads. Your hipness is under attack as we speak,\" joked CBS\\'s Chenda Ngak.\\n\\nDuring the third quarter of 2011, Samsung surged past Apple to the number one spot among phone manufacturers, based on shipments. No longer was the smartphone war a battle between Apple and a tangle of obscure Android me-too phones. Now it was a two-horse race. Everyone else had fallen by the wayside.\\n\\nTrucks carrying fresh apples started arriving at the Texas headquarters of Samsung. Bushel baskets were placed in the elevator banks and break rooms, so that wherever Samsung employees took a coffee break, they were reminded of their mission -- to take a bite out of Apple.\\n\\nExcerpted from Samsung Rising: The Inside Story of the South Korean Giant That Set Out to Beat Apple and Conquer Tech © 2020 by Geoffrey Cain.

       "    'body': 'Apple just can\\'t keep a secret these days. Experts expect few surprises after \\'a thorough leaking of Apple\\'s most likely plans.\\'\\n\\nApple just can\\'t keep a secret these days.\\n\\n\"There\\'s been a thorough leaking of Apple\\'s most likely plans,\" said Ezra Gottheil, an analyst with Technology Business Research (TBI), on what Apple will unveil later today at an event on its Cupertino, Calif. campus. \"But even without the leaks, there\\'s not a whole lot of places to take the iPhone.\"\\n\\nSix experts from six different research firms agreed that there would be few surprises from Apple, in large part because of the global sieve made up of Asian parts suppliers and ueber-aggressive bloggers.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll see a lower-cost iPhone, in addition to the new flagship model,\" said Kevin Restivo, an IDC analyst, in an interview.\\n\\n\"No epiphanies here,\" admitted Charles Golvin of Forrester. \"There will be an iPhone 5S that will be to the 5 what the 4S and 3GS were to the 4 and 3G, respectively: Same industrial design, new processor to boost performance, improvements to the imaging experience, apparently growing color options, plus some form of biometric in place of the unlock swipe.\"\\n\\nAll the analysts bet Apple will host a double bill by unwrapping not only the annual upgrade to what Restivo called the \"flagship,\" but also a first-ever lower-priced iPhone.\\n\\nPundits have labeled the flagship as the iPhone 5S, a nod to 2011\\'s iPhone 4S that followed the iPhone 4, and the cheaper model the iPhone 5C, with the \"C\" possibly standing for \"color,\" as it\\'s to come in at least five colors, some of them reminiscent of those in the rainbow-themed logo Apple ditched in 1998.\\n\\nBecause the iPhone 5S will likely feature the same exterior design as last year\\'s iPhone 5 -- Apple typically refreshes every two years -- the analysts\\' attention will be squarely on the iPhone 5C.\\n\\nThat attention will be drawn not to the specifications of the lower-cost model -- or the number of colors -- but to its price. It\\'s that, one of the few details that hasn\\'t leaked, which will determine their appraisals of what will arguably be Apple\\'s biggest strategic move in smartphones since it rolled out the original six years ago.\\n\\n\"It all hinges on what the iPhone 5C is priced at,\" said Restivo. \"It has to create the lust for the newer model that it\\'s done for the flagship. Apple has always succeeded by selling the latest and greatest. Even in emerging markets, where people would be expected to make the compromise [of buying older iPhones at lower prices], that\\'s more important than Apple once thought.\"\\n\\nThe iPhone 5C will be a departure for Apple: It has never shipped more than one model each year. But a hard-charging Samsung and countless cheaper models from others, all running Android, have erased significant portions of the iPhone\\'s global market share. Rather than continue to rely on selling older models at cheaper prices, its strategy for several years, Apple needs an all-new lower-priced iPhone to maintain growth and profitability -- to please Wall Street, which has hammered Apple\\'s stock in the last 12 months -- by broadening the potential pool of buyers.\\n\\nOther experts have argued that Apple needs a cheaper iPhone, one that can compete in the huge swaths of the world where carrier subsidies are rare or non-existent, to maintain its market share so that developers remain committed to the app ecosystem.\\n\\nApple must walk a fine line, everyone agreed: Price the iPhone 5C too low and it will cannibalize sales of the iPhone 5S flagship in regions like the U.S., Western Europe and Japan. Price it too high and it won\\'t kick start more sales in places like China, India and Brazil, where ultra-cheap Android smartphones have grabbed large parts of the market.\\n\\nSome analysts, like Benedict Evans of Enders, has said that price is really all that matters.\\n\\nAs far as price expectations, the experts concurred that $300 marked the lowest Apple will go -- and that would be aggressive -- but differed on the high end. Some thought that $400 was the most that Apple would demand for an iPhone 5C minus a contract, while others went as high as $500.\\n\\nThe price will be intensely dissected as experts and pundits weigh in on whether it will drive new sales, cannibalize the iPhone 5S, and move the needle against Android. Failure to impress with the price and the explanation for why it\\'s entering what in reality is the mid-priced market, will be punished by observers, and most likely Wall Street as well.\\n\\nSo there\\'s a lot at stake.\\n\\n\"This year\\'s rollout is much more important as Apple has lost market share to Android since the last iPhone,\" said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.\\n\\nSameer Singh, an analyst who covers mobile technologies on his Tech-Thoughts website, echoed Moorhead. \"I think this launch is much more important than last year\\'s,\" Singh said in an email reply to questions. \"iPhone shipment growth has slowed and ASP has been declining. Apple needs to jumpstart growth again.\"\\n\\nUnlike his fellow analysts, Singh believed that Apple will rely primarily on new carrier announcements -- talk has swirled that China Mobile, that nation\\'s and the world\\'s largest, and Japan\\'s NTT DoCoMo have signed or are near to inking agreements to carry the iPhone -- rather than on the success of the iPhone 5C.\\n\\n\"It is important because as the technology pace is slowing down and the addressable market is saturated, Apple needs to think where they want to go next with iPhone,\" said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Gartner. \"Should they move their hero product role to something else and just improve their margins and share in the phone market? It seems that with an iPhone 6 not coming this time around they might just be doing that.\"\\n\\nMilanesi, along with others, including Charles Golvin of Forrester, saw the focus today on the business side, not on the technology Apple reveals.\\n\\n\"Many talk more about market share but the issue is really more about margins and profitability,\" Milanesi said.\\n\\n\"I think there are more business questions like growth rate and margin than there are product and design questions,\" added Golvin in an email reply to questions.\\n\\nIf that\\'s an accurate take on the post-game analysis it would mark a vivid deviation from the norm. Traditionally, Apple has wowed its fans -- and many observers -- with its technological acumen and glitzy new features, not price, which has not changed since 2008 when subsidies first became the foundation of Apple\\'s business model, and enormous profits.\\n\\nA technological song and dance won\\'t be absent from today\\'s event: Apple will trumpet speed increases and new functionality built into the iPhone 5S. Just as important, it will also highlight some of the changes, additions and enhancements in iOS 7. But attention on the iPhone 5C and its impact will be paramount.\\n\\nNot that there\\'s anything wrong with that. In fact, it\\'s as much a sign of the smartphone market as of Apple, some contended. \"This will be a reflection of the maturation of the market more than the device and the form factor,\" said Restivo. \"It\\'s a question of market evolution. Apple\\'s hardest act to follow is always itself. But the premium pricing model is at a ceiling, and Apple won\\'t solve the market share problem without [the iPhone 5C] at the right price.\"\\n\\nDuring the event, which should last around 90 minutes if Apple keeps to past practice, CEO Tim Cook and other executives will be watched closely, not only for what they say, but how they say it, analysts said.\\n\\n\"It will be important to watch for the speakers\\' subtleties that explain away Apple\\'s lost market share or perceived lack of continued innovation,\" said Moorhead.\\n\\nGottheil said much the same. \"There\\'s nothing specific I will watch for, but I will for the feel of the event,\" he said. \"Apple has fallen into a defensiveness about its perceived lack of innovation.\"\\n\\nAs an example, both Gottheil and Colvin cited Philip Schiller\\'s remark during June\\'s Worldwide Developer Conference. When Apple\\'s head of marketing introduced a radically-redesigned Mac Pro, he pointedly said, \"Can\\'t innovate anymore, my ass.\"\\n\\n\"Also at stake [today] are the continued questions about whether the company has lost its innovation edge,\" said Golvin. \"I don\\'t subscribe to this mindset but clearly the company hears these criticisms.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s unlikely Apple will answer those critics today unless the event sports a Jobsian \"One more thing\" moment where Cook pulls an enormous rabbit out a hat.\\n\\nAnalysts want to be surprised too, and would love to see a \"One more thing.\" But when asked what they would like to see that they thought they wouldn\\'t, their wish lists were all over the map.\\n\\nMoorhead pegged the long-rumored iWatch: \"I would like to see Apple\\'s vision of a wearable device that is very different from what Samsung and Sony are currently bringing to the table,\" he said.\\n\\nGottheil wanted a larger-screen iPhone that could compete with the \"phablet\" craze sweeping China and other Asian markets. Golvin asked for a redesigned iPhone 5S, not a repeat of last year\\'s look-and-feel.\\n\\nSome were less ambitious in their hopes and named things that were actually feasible. Milanesi, for example, wanted Apple to spend time showing services and apps specific for the iPhone 5C, including China-only services. \"This will be a key differentiator over the cheaper Android devices,\" she said. \"Ecosystem will still be a valued differentiator.\"\\n\\nAnd Singh simply wanted lower prices than analysts have bandied about. \"An emerging markets-only iPhone 5C for $299 and Retina iPad Mini for $249 would do the trick,\" he said, admitting that those numbers were extremely unlikely.\\n\\nBut don\\'t figure on being blown away, said Gottheil, who lowered the bar. Apple will not suddenly morph into a cut-rate smartphone supplier or change its spots today.\\n\\n\"Apple has to live with their position,\" Gottheil said. \"Theirs is that we\\'re Lexus, we\\'re not Toyota. The expectation that that will change is kind of crazy. But perception is very important. The company appears to be under fire, but it has a solid business and astoundingly loyal customers. I don\\'t think there\\'s anything they could do today that would turn around that thinking.\"\\n\\nApple will start its event today at 10 a.m. PDT.\\n\\nGregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

       "    'title': 'The Future of the iPad',\n",
       "    'body': 'It\\'s been an eventful decade for the iPad. But what\\'s next?\\n\\nThere\\'s never been a more exciting time to use the iPad. Yet as far as the device has come, we remain optimistic that its best days are still ahead.\\n\\nBefore wrapping up this anniversary week, we have to consider the future of the iPad.\\n\\nFederico: As I shared yesterday in my Modular Computer piece, I strongly believe the iPad hardware story should continue over the next decade with a focus on modularity. If there\\'s anything we\\'ve learned from the iPad Pro line since its debut five years ago - and particularly over the last couple years - it\\'s that Apple is increasingly leaning into modularity as a differentiating factor from the Mac. The company started moving its first steps into this field with the original Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil; they continued to extend the iPad\\'s flexibility with the adoption of USB-C in 2018; and just a few weeks ago, they brought deep, extensive integration with mice and trackpads to iPadOS. While a Mac will always be a Mac - the type of computer you buy is what it\\'s always going to be - an iPad can be continuously transformed by the extra hardware paired with it. This, I believe, is the most interesting hardware angle to consider right now for the future of the device.\\n\\nI see a handful of different ways Apple may go about this strategy over the next few years. Aside from the upcoming Magic Keyboard (yet another accessory that is set to fundamentally transform interactions with the iPad Pro), I see proper integration with external displays as the next big item to tick on Apple\\'s checklist. Right now, the iPad Pro can mirror its UI to external displays via USB-C, HDMI, or AirPlay; the default UI mirroring mode is limited, however, by pillarboxing, which prevents apps from fully taking advantage of an external display. Some apps can output full-screen UI to a monitor via an old API originally designed for games, but that secondary UI cannot be interacted with using the new system pointer.\\n\\nHere\\'s what I think Apple should do: the company should introduce a new API that supports iPadOS\\' UIScene technology for multiwindowing and allow users to choose which windows (window in the sense of an iPad app window - more details here) should be placed on an external display; unlike the current UI mirroring mode, those windows should be able to fill the entire display and users should be able to control them using the new native pointer. The fact that Apple added pointer support in iPadOS 13.4 rather than waiting for 14 later this year makes me somewhat optimistic about getting a new integration with external displays in the near future.\\n\\nUSB is the other angle to keep an eye on for the future of the iPad as a modular computer. It was great to see Apple add support for connecting USB drives to the device in iPadOS 13, but more can be done in this regard to further open the iPad to different use cases. Put simply, I believe you should be able to use any peripheral you plug into a Mac with an iPad as well. Whether it\\'s an external audio interface, a scanner, or an optical drive, you shouldn\\'t be forced to \"get a Mac\" just to use a USB accessory that currently doesn\\'t work with the iPad. As I also suggested yesterday, Apple has the opportunity here to rethink how the necessary drivers for these accessories are distributed for iPadOS.\\n\\nBy focusing on modularity, Apple can continue making the iPad a more versatile and extensible platform without fundamentally changing its nature as a tablet. Adding support for external displays, pointing devices, and USB accessories doesn\\'t change the fact you can still pick up an iPad and hold it in your hands - and I don\\'t ever want that basic aspect of the experience to change. Otherwise I would, in fact, just get a Mac.\\n\\nAt the same time, however, I can\\'t help but wish for an even bigger iPad Pro (somewhere between 14\" and 16\") that could be advertised as a \"desk and couch\" tablet, specifically optimized for drawing and productivity apps. With an even bigger display, such an iPad Pro could comfortably support up to three apps in Split View, for example, and allow professional applications such as LumaFusion and Photoshop (and maybe even Logic and Xcode by Apple?) to offer desktop-class interfaces on a device that supports both touch and external input.\\n\\nThen, of course, there\\'s the idea of a \"drafting table iPad\" that would essentially be Apple\\'s answer to the Microsoft Surface Studio. I would buy that product in a heartbeat, but I understand if Apple may want to start \"small\" and release a 15\" iPad Pro first. Regardless, as soon as a larger iPad Pro comes out, I know I\\'m going to be very interested in one.\\n\\nJohn: The iPad Pro\\'s importance to the entire iPad line can\\'t be understated. Whether you use Apple\\'s largest, most powerful tablet or not, if you have any iPad, the Pro has likely affected the way you use it.\\n\\nIt has been over four years since the first iPad Pro was delivered to customers. In that time, the Pro\\'s accessories, which felt like high-end exclusives when they were released, have trickled down to other models of iPad. Their expansion across the lineup isn\\'t something that is written about very often, but when you look at Apple\\'s entire iPad lineup, it\\'s remarkable just how impactful those accessories have become. The Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard have become part of what an iPad is.\\n\\nThe Apple Pencil is probably the most important accessory available for any Apple product today, because it\\'s what sets Apple\\'s tablets apart from their competition. Other companies make styluses, but even now, the first-generation Apple Pencil\\'s tight integration of hardware and software has no peer.\\n\\niPads like the mini and 10.2-inch iPad don\\'t support the Pro\\'s second-generation Pencil, but even so, it\\'s an accessory that allows users to greatly expand the way they use the iPad through activities like drawing and note-taking. I find myself using the Apple Pencil that I bought for my 2015 iPad Pro with my iPad mini all the time for note-taking and navigating its UI. The first-generation Pencil is less convenient to charge than the current model, but it still works like a champ almost five years later.\\n\\nThe Smart Keyboard has had a similar impact. It\\'s not available for the mini, and I doubt it ever will be given the device\\'s size, but it transforms the 10.2-inch iPad into an ultraportable device that quickly switches personalities. Without a USB-C port, the modularity of the device isn\\'t as flexible as the Pro, but the core of the experience that Federico described in his story yesterday is just as true for these iPads.\\n\\nWhen I look at what the future might hold for the iPad, I expect this accessory trickle-down trend to continue. When Apple announced the 2020 iPad Pro last month, it showed off the new cantilevered Magic Keyboard. The keyboard is expensive at $349 for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, but I expect that like the Apple Pencil, that price will come down over time and we\\'ll see a version of it available for other iPads too.\\n\\nI also expect we will eventually see USB-C trickle down to the entire iPad line as a way to enhance its modularity. The Lightning connector has served Apple well, but USB-C is playing a larger and larger role in the adaptability of the iPad Pro. Based on what we\\'ve seen with Apple\\'s own accessories, I expect it\\'s only a matter of time before USB-C plays a similar role across the entire iPad line.\\n\\nA USB-C port alone isn\\'t exciting, but its implications are. There will always be differences between Apple\\'s least and most expensive iPads, but by bringing the core experience of accessories like the Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard to all iPads, Apple is setting up a future where the primary differentiator between devices will be their screen size, not their capabilities. The Pro models will continue being the place where new features are introduced first, and there will be differences at the margins like there are now between the screen technologies used in each model, but the prospect of every iPad gaining the flexibility of the Pro is within reach and exciting.\\n\\nRyan: Earlier this week, in a story about developing apps for iPad, I stated that \"the device\\'s very nature - a slab of glass that becomes its software - evokes countless possibilities.\" As I think about the future of the iPad, I can\\'t help but go back to pulling that same thread. While advancements in hardware are important, they\\'re ultimately just a means to the end of enabling new experiences, new ways of that slab of glass transforming into something unique. In other words, the hardware\\'s evolution is all about serving the software.\\n\\nOften when a device is 10 years into its life, the time for innovation and experimentation has passed. But for the iPad, it\\'s been less than a year since Apple set it on a fresh path with the advent of iPadOS. The new OS indicates a new sense of independence and identity for the device, and iPadOS 13.4 proves that Apple is just getting started with evolving the iPad\\'s software. While I don\\'t expect this fall\\'s version 14 to offer too much new or revolutionary, since the past year has brought so much change already, I\\'m more confident than ever that the future of iPadOS is bright.\\n\\nAs the iPad enters this next decade, it carries tremendous opportunity to become the computer of the future. This is where I believe Apple\\'s focus for the device, and especially its OS, will lie moving forward: making it the best computer for most people.\\n\\nWhat will that require?\\n\\nRethinking multitasking. This subject has been covered a lot, by plenty of different people in recent months. I even outlined my own concept for how Apple could evolve multitasking to make it more accessible. I think my context menu-centric approach could work just as well, if not better even, now that we have proper mouse and trackpad support on iPad. I won\\'t rehash the details of my idea - you can read the article for all the specifics - but instead simply reiterate that something does need to change before the iPad can become the best computer for the most people. Multitasking operations like Split View and Slide Over need to be easier to learn, but without losing any of their current capabilities. While I think iPadOS 14 is likely too soon to see these changes, I expect them no later than version 15 next year.\\n\\nMore consistent app experiences. Besides rethinking multitasking, I think the next best thing Apple can do for the iPad\\'s future is to create more system APIs and tools to help developers offer consistent experiences across their apps. This was a major point emphasized by the developers I recently spoke with: too many app features have to be built from scratch by developers with entirely custom implementations. Things like modal sheets, advanced keyboard controls, file system integration, drag and drop, and multiwindow are all functions that developers in the last decade have had to build custom versions of because Apple didn\\'t offer native solutions. A lot of positive change has taken place in this regard, but there\\'s plenty more to be done. The more that Apple invests in designing key functionality that can then be given to developers through new APIs, the better experience will be had by iPad users who find that the apps they use share a common ethos in design. I\\'m not saying every app should be identical, or shouldn\\'t innovate in their own ways, only that common functions should be done the Apple-prescribed \"iPad way,\" via the help of APIs from the mothership.\\n\\nContinued expansion of sales models. This is again a continuation of something Apple\\'s already doing, but developers could use more ways of structuring their businesses than what\\'s currently available today. Things have gotten better ever since Phil Schiller took responsibility for the App Store, with changes like the expansion of subscription options to more apps. However, not every app is a good fit for a subscription, so Apple should offer more avenues for apps to build sustainable businesses in alternative ways.\\n\\nApple leading the way with its apps. I use a lot of Apple apps because I think the company, for the most part, does a great job with its first-party offerings. I\\'m not in the camp that believes the company can\\'t make good apps anymore. That said, though, I do think Apple could do more to inspire developers toward greater creativity on the platform. The early days of the iPad were marked by remarkable experiences like GarageBand and full-fledged versions of iWork. While there have been some great app redesigns of late, such as the revamped App Store and Books apps, it\\'s been a very long time since Apple created brand new iPad apps that served to inspire. I hope that changes soon.\\n\\nThere\\'s more that could be said about the iPad\\'s software, including how its OS and apps could evolve, but these few things listed would, I believe, go a long way toward making iPad the primary computer for a lot more people.',\n",

       "    'title': \"10 things you (probably) didn't know about Apple Watch\",\n",
       "    'body': 'In just a few short years, Apple Watch transformed the smartwatch from pricey novelty to potential lifesaver. But how much do you know about Apple\\'s breakthrough smartwatch? Is it time (pun intended) to pick up some new Apple Watch trivia? You\\'ve come to the right place.\\n\\nHere are 10 things you (probably) don\\'t know about the Apple Watch.\\n\\nCupertino launched Apple Watch on April 24, 2015. At the time, CEO Tim Cook described the company\\'s first wearable as the \"next chapter in Apple history.\" Rudimentary at first, the device continues to evolve, with Apple adding fitness features and health-related hardware upgrades. In just five years, Apple Watch found its footing and went on to dominate the smartwatch market.\\n\\nBut you knew that already. These lesser-known bits of Apple Watch trivia will give you a more well-rounded picture of the groundbreaking device.\\n\\nEarly on, the Apple Watch looked more like an iPhone accessory than its own product. In fact, the idea of an Apple Watch was to get people to stop spending their lives staring at an iPhone.\\n\\n\"People are carrying their phones with them and looking at the screen so much,\" Kevin Lynch, one of the Apple engineers who helped bring the Apple Watch to market, told Wired around the time of the device\\'s launch. \"People want that level of engagement. But how do we provide it in a way that\\'s a little more human, a little more in the moment when you\\'re with somebody?\"\\n\\nThe first prototype Apple Watch was an iPhone attached to the wearer with a Velcro strap and a custom dongle for the Digital Crown. They developed a custom app, which appeared the size of a watch face in the center of the iPhone screen, to give a sense of necessary scale.\\n\\nMonths before the Apple Watch went on sale, game developer NimbleBit built a simple word game called Letterpad. Ultimately, Apple Watch gaming never really took off. But this was the first time most people thought about gaming on their wrists since the days of the Nintendo Game & Watch three decades earlier.\\n\\nIt turns out that a device that continually tracks movement and heart rate can help catch wrongdoers. In one case, a Michigan man claimed he was attacked at his place of work, only for his Apple Watch heart rate monitor to show that he was lying. He later admitted to making up the whole thing.\\n\\nIn another, an Apple Watch helped reveal exactly when a murder victim\\'s heartbeat stopped. This alerted authorities that a murder had taken place much earlier than thought.\\n\\nThe $10,000 gold Apple Watch Edition never really took off as a luxury product the way Cupertino intended. But it wasn\\'t because of a lack of effort or innovation. As part of the development process, Apple actually created a new kind of gold.\\n\\nThis process involved packing molecules together more closely, consequently making it harder than standard gold. It also meant Apple had to use less gold in each unit. That\\'s why, while the Apple Watch Edition was expensive, it wasn\\'t solid gold expensive.\\n\\nBefore the Apple Watch came out, Jony Ive was quoted as saying that the Swiss watch industry was \"f***ed.\" While plenty of people still buy mechanical Swiss watches, there\\'s no doubt that Apple Watch sales blindsided these traditional watchmakers.\\n\\nNot just one or two of the leading manufacturers, either. According to a recent report from Strategy Analytics, the total number of Apple Watches shipped last year came in 45% higher than the output of the entire Swiss watch industry.\\n\\nA 2015 profile in The New Yorker posed a question to Apple exec Jeff Williams. Was the Apple Watch more purely the work of design chief Jony Ive than previous Apple products? \"After a silence of twenty-five seconds, during which Apple made fifty thousand dollars in profit, he said, \\'Yes,\\'\" the article noted.\\n\\nApple quickly moved from marketing Apple Watch as a fashion accessory to selling it as a fitness device. Since fashion seems to have been Ive\\'s focus for the wearable, it makes you wonder if the speedy transition expedited Ive\\'s departure from Apple in 2019.\\n\\nHackers have used watchOS, the Apple Watch\\'s operating system, as an emulation platform for old-school operating systems. Nick Lee managed to get both Windows 95 and Mac OS System 7.5.5 running on Apple Watch. There\\'s no real practical reason you\\'d want to, but it\\'s still pretty neat that you can.\\n\\nThe Apple Watch was the first new product Apple set out to create after CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs\\' death in late 2011. According to Apple analyst Tim Bajarin, the concept of building a health-tracking device came as a direct response to Jobs\\' battle with cancer.\\n\\n\"During this time, Jobs discovered how disjointed the healthcare system can be,\" Bajarin wrote. \"He took on the task of trying to bring some digital order to various aspects of the healthcare system, especially the connection between patients, their data, and their healthcare providers.\"\\n\\nWell, kind of. In 1995, Cupertino created an Apple-branded wristwatch bearing the company logo and offered it as a freebie to Macintosh System 7.5 upgraders. Today, these original Apple watches are collectors items. You can expect to pay a couple hundred bucks for one on eBay if one shows up on the auction site.\\n\\nIf you know other interesting Apple Watch tidbits or trivia, sound off in the comments below.',\n",

       "    'title': 'New Apple TV could boast an upgraded processor and new Siri remote, rumour claims',\n",
       "    'body': 'The Apple TV 4K is a great bit of kit, offering a way for Apple fans to enjoy the likes of Apple TV+, Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube and more in 4K HDR, but with every tvOS upgrade, it gets a little bit slower. Combine that with the fact that the A10 Fusion chipset struggles to run the majority of Apple Arcade titles in 4K at a playable frame rate, and it\\'s clear to see that the Apple TV is due for a refresh soon.\\n\\nIt looks like that\\'ll be the case, with references to the so-called \"Apple TV 6\" spotted in tvOS 13.4 beta code and recent reports claiming that it\\'ll pack an upgraded processor and increased storage. Here\\'s all you need to know about the new Apple TV, including the latest release date, price, features and spec rumours.\\n\\nApple TV 2020 release date\\n\\nApple last updated the Apple TV back in 2017, but unlike the iPhone, Apple doesn\\'t tend to stick to the same release schedule with the Apple TV. That has been ramped up further recently, with Apple randomly releasing new products like the iPad Pro 2020 and MacBook Air 2020 via press release with very little fanfare, and although some expect this is to do with Coronavirus, it\\'s something Apple has been doing for a couple of years now.\\n\\nWith that being said, joint reports from YouTube channel iUpdate and The Verifier suggest that we should see a new Apple TV on the market sometime before the end of this year. We\\'d take that with a pinch of salt right now, with the Coronavirus outbreak having an effect on supply chains and retail stores worldwide, but it\\'s good to know that a release should be on the cards soon.\\n\\nApple TV 2020 price\\n\\nYou can pick up the current Apple TV 4K in two specifications - 32 GB and 46GB - for £179/$179 and £199/$199 respectively. This puts the Apple TV comfortably at the high-end of the market, with key rivals like the 4K HDR-enabled Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K retailing at £49/$49, and you can pick up a Google Chromecast Ultra for £69/$69. In fact, the only real high-end competitor to the Apple TV is the £149/$149 Nvidia Shield TV.\\n\\nWhile we\\'d love to say that the Apple TV 2020 will be cheaper than the current range, we highly doubt Apple will drop the price. After all, it offers the fourth-gen Apple TV for £149/$149 and that, in Apple\\'s eyes, is the budget-friendly option.\\n\\nDon\\'t expect Apple to drop the price of the Apple TV 4K when the new model comes out either - we fully expect Apple to drop the current 4K from its lineup, keeping the older fourth-gen Apple TV as a cheaper alternative. After all, it\\'s what Apple did with the Apple Watch range when the Series 5 was released, ditching the near-identical Series 4 but continuing to offer the older Series 3 alongside the Series 5.\\n\\nApple TV 2020 features and spec rumours\\n\\nThe first hint about the existence of a new Apple TV came with the release of the tvOS 13.4 beta code. As reported by 9to5Mac, the beta code revealed a new Apple TV with codename \"T1125\", with the T representing an internal model - probably a prototype - that isn\\'t quite ready for prime time just yet.\\n\\nWhile the code didn\\'t reveal the specifics of the unannounced Apple TV, it did suggest that the new hardware would be based on the arm64e architecture - the same as what\\'s used in the A12 and A13 Bionic chipsets, representing a huge step forward from the ageing A10 Fusion chip found in the Apple TV 4K. The resolution will stay at 4K, suggesting that the upgraded power will be used to improve Apple Arcade game performance - an issue that plagues the current-gen hardware.\\n\\nAs well as predicting the Apple TV 2020 release date, iUpdate and The Verifier jointly reported a few key details about the upcoming set-top box. The storage is set to be upgraded from 23- and 64GB to 64- and 128GB respectively, offering more space for users to download Apple Arcade titles, and although it won\\'t be exclusive to the new model, the upcoming Apple TV will launch alongside a new Kids Mode. The idea is that parents can create separate accounts for the kids with finer controls over the apps that can be accessed.\\n\\nThe reports also claim that the new version of tvOS, said to be released at the same time as the Apple TV, will introduce Screen Time to the range. It\\'s also claimed that Apple is working on a \"redesigned Apple TV+ with a greater focus on content\" but key details of the redesign are unclear right now.\\n\\nA separate report from 9to5Mac claims that a new Apple TV remote is in the works, as discovered via leaked iOS 14 code, but details about new features are scarce right now.',\n",

       "    'body': 'The 2020 Apple TV update looks to pack a punch with family-friendly updates and more storage for content.\\n\\nWhat, exactly, will the Apple TV 2020 offer to existing Apple TV owners (and potential switchers) to convince them to buy? Well, new rumors leaking out about a so-called Apple TV 6 (probably not the final name) give us reason to believe that we\\'re getting a new device, the first new Apple TV hardware since 2017\\'s Apple TV 4K.\\n\\nIn the time since then, the Cupertino-based company released multiple subscription services that work on its streaming boxes. Apple Arcade is likely the most successful of the two, though we\\'ve become fond of a couple of Apple TV Plus shows.\\n\\nWhile it still feels like we\\'re in the early days of Apple TV 2020 rumors and a bit far off from its actual release, it could very well drop any week now. The current Apple TV 4K is one of our best streaming devices picks, but it\\'s got the title as \"for Apple fans only,\" meaning Apple has many ways it could make this device more appealing -- including lowering the price).\\n\\nHere\\'s everything you need to know about the Apple TV 2020:\\n\\nThe last Apple TV was released in Sept. 2017, but that doesn\\'t mean Apple will stick to that timetable. Right now, there\\'s no schedule for when we should expect the next Apple TV to be announced, because all tech press events are off the table until coronavirus concerns and quarantines end.\\n\\nWhich leaves us to Apple\\'s current pattern of \"announce things when we want to,\" which it did in mid-March, rolling out the iPad Pro 2020 and the MacBook Air 2020 in press releases at 8am Eastern. The company could do the same with the Apple TV 2020.\\n\\nThe current Apple TV 4K starts at $179, which is a lot more money than most competing streaming devices. For example, the Roku Ultra, which supports 4K HDR content and comes with a voice remote, costs $99. And the Amazon Fire TV Cube, which has Alexa built in and can control your cable box, costs $119. Hopefully Apple lowers its pricing for the Apple TV 2020.\\n\\nIt appears the Apple TV 2020, in terms of what\\'s changing, may be more about video games than streaming. The first Apple TV 2020 rumor we saw pointed to an overdue speed boost update, that would allow for a new processor. Signs suggests it could be either Apple\\'s A12 or A13 Bionic chip, which are a part of the iPhone generations from 2019 and 2018. To put that in perspective, the most recent Apple TV uses A10 Fusion chip technology, which has been circulating since its 2016 debut in the iPhone 7.\\n\\nSince the current processors are plenty fast for binge-watching Apple TV Plus shows, Netfix marathons and other live TV apps, this upgrade is probably meant to give the box more gaming prowess, as the Apple TV is one of the Apple Arcade platforms.\\n\\nThe latest rumor, which 9to5Mac pulled from prominent YouTubers, is that the Apple TV 2020 will come in 64GB and 128GB capacities, doubling the Apple TV 4K\\'s 32GB and 64GB drives. Again, this is most likely for games, allowing for users to keep a larger library of titles on their Apple TV, and allow for even more complex games.\\n\\nApple\\'s plans to upgrade tvOS this year were also leaked by the YouTubers that 9to5Mac covered. This update should include a new Kids Mode to be added to the Apple TV. This will allow parents to create a profile/account for a child, that they can manage using parental controls. It should roll out to the Apple TV HD and Apple TV 4K as well.\\n\\nAnd, since this is an Apple operating system, expect the activity-tracking Screen Time functionality to come with the next tvOS. I can\\'t wait to see how much time I spend watching YouTube on my TV.\\n\\nLastly, Apple wants to redesign the Apple TV Plus experience for \"a greater focus on content,\" which sounds like Apple really wants to make us aware of how great its shows are.\\n\\nWe\\'d love to see a new Apple TV remote that doesn\\'t rely on the touchpad (which can be finicky for some) for navigation. And leaked iOS 14 code suggests a new Apple TV remote is coming. However, we don\\'t if the new remote for the Apple TV 2020 will change the input method or not.',\n",

       "    'body': \"Millennials are quick to associate Apple with its status as being a global leader in technology and for good reason. The company deserves credit for creating the modern smartphone: sexy, exciting, and productive. But few are unaware of Apple's roots as a struggling computer company that was once on the verge of bankruptcy. The Apple share price history reflects this reality.\\n\\nApple was co-founded by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in 1976 and one year later launched the Apple II computer. The company, officially known at the time as Apple Computers Inc, went public on the Nasdaq stock exchange on 12 December 1980, at a split-adjusted cost of 39 cents per share. Four years later Apple launched the first Macintosh computer.\\n\\nApple's board of directors ousted Jobs from the company in 1985 only for him to return as CEO in 1997. At that time, Apple was on the verge of bankruptcy but Jobs had a turnaround plan, including securing a $150 million investment from Microsoft to support Office products for the Mac.\\n\\nBy October 1997, Apple stock growth history hadn't started yet as shares were trading at 78 cents (split-adjusted) a piece. Savvy investors who recognised Jobs' vision were in for a treat over the coming decades. Apple's 1998 launch of the iMac was an important moment for Apple but not as important for Apple stock history.\\n\\n2001 marks the official start of Apple's new era when it launched the iPod in November. Surprisingly, investors were unimpressed as shares gained a mere 5 cents to close the trading session at $9.38 (not adjusted for splits).\\n\\nTen million devices were sold through the end of 2004 and Apple's stock increased more than three-fold since the initial launch.\\n\\nApple's stock price increased over the years and rose to $92.54 on 9 January 2007, which corresponds to the day Jobs first introduced the concept of the iPhone. When the new phone was launched on 1 June shares were trading at $122.01.\\n\\nHere is a summary of future iPhone launch dates through to 2014, the next important milestone in Apple shares history.\\n\\nApple initiated a two-for-one stock split in 1987, 2000, and 2005 but Apple stock growth history over the years dictated a much larger split was needed to maintain a healthy base of retail investors.\\n\\nApple's stock had risen to a whopping $655.90 on the day a seven-for-one stock split became official on 9 June 2014. The surge over the years is directly attributed to Apple not only growing sales of its devices but smashing expectations - in every region it operates in.\\n\\nApple stock performance and momentum continued throughout the late 2000s and into the new decade with the April 2010 launch of the first iPad. Unfortunately, the early start of the decade is also highlighted with the death of Jobs who stepped down in August 2011 and died around two months later at the age of 56.\\n\\nApple's stock was trading at $54.03 on the day of his death on 5 October 2011. The stock didn't show any negative movement as Jobs' health issues were well known by the market. His successor and current CEO Tim Cook was widely viewed at the time as having a stronger business sense - a much-needed quality given Apple's already successful technological evolution.\\n\\nCook also introduced new shareholder-friendly initiatives, including reintroducing a cash dividend in 2012 and committing to annual increases in 2016. Under Cook's leadership some of the biggest names in investing found the stock attractive. Most notably, billionaire investor Warren Buffett and his Berkshire Hathaway bought a stake in Apple in the low $100s - an odd move for the savvy investor who historically shied away from tech investments.\\n\\nBuffett's nod of approval in 2016 was followed up with subsequent purchases over the years. Everything was going great and Apple's valuation hit the coveted $1 trillion mark in 2018. However, sentiment quickly reversed as investors and analysts started to question if peak Apple stock performance had passed.\\n\\nAll concerns were confirmed in early 2019 when Apple issued its first profit warning in 16 years. The company said in January it expects total revenue to be $9 billion less than prior estimates, partly due to poor performance in China. Shares of Apple had fallen from above $230 in 2018 to below $150.\\n\\nBut investors who counted Apple to be down and out were on the losing side of the trade and missed out on a whopping 89 per cent surge throughout 2019.\\n\\nThe Street was debating in early 2020 when Apple would become a $2 trillion company.\\n\\nAnd then the coronavirus happened and all bets were suddenly off the table.\\n\\nApple's stock peaked at $327.85 before investors started questioning what impact the coronavirus would not only have on consumer demand worldwide but to its supply chain. Apple depends on factories across China to manufacture its devices.\\n\\nLaura Martin, an analyst with Needham, said under a worst-case scenario, 32 per cent of Apple's entire business could be disrupted. She said unless Apple's factories are fully operating by June, it won't be able to launch a new iPhone device in 2020.\\n\\nAnd this is where we are today with Apple's stock. As of 13 March, the Apple share graph has lost more than 6 per cent since the start of the year which is better than the broader Nasdaq index that has fallen more than 12 per cent.\\n\\nInvestors are likely assuming any loss in sales amid the coronavirus scare will merely be pushed to a later date. So the impact on Apple's financials will be temporary, followed by a surge in demand once the coronavirus outbreak eases.\\n\\nThis is ultimately the best-case-scenario but doesn't assume there will be any change in consumer behaviour once the coronavirus becomes old news. Will consumers want to spend as much money as before on devices instead of saving cash for emergencies? This is ultimately the key question that will dictate Apple's stock performance but also a question no one can answer today.\\n\\nStay tuned to the latest stock market news, which can drive AAPL stock price movement.

       "    'title': '17+ ways Apple is responding to coronavirus',\n",
       "    'body': 'Teams across Apple are attempting to find ways to respond to the pandemic that\\'s engulfing the globe.\\n\\nApple is attempting to do as much as it can to contribute to the global response to the Coronavirus pandemic. We\\'ve identified 17 things Apple has done so far, quite apart from the work it will be doing behind the scenes to fix its supply chains, in the fight.\\n\\nApple warned its investors\\n\\nApple in mid-February warned investors that it would fail to meet its previous estimated revenue targets of $63 billion to $67 billion. At the time, it cited lower customer demand in Greater China, but this now seems to have become a global problem. The company\\'s stock continues to decline, though most analysts anticipate recovery toward the end of the year.\\n\\nWWDC will be held online, not in place\\n\\nApple will not hold its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Jose this year. Instead of inviting thousands of the most important people in its community to get together in one place, the company will hold its conference online instead. It promises its show will still be packed with information.\\n\\nCraig Federighi, Apple\\'s senior vice president of Software Engineering said:\\n\\n\"I look forward to our developers getting their hands on the new code and interacting in entirely new ways with the Apple engineers building the technologies and frameworks that will shape the future across all Apple platforms.\"\\n\\nNo March event?\\n\\nApple had been expected to announce new products during a March special launch event. These were thought to be new iPad Pro models, new Macs and the iPhone 9/iPhone SE device. Apple did announce Macs and the new iPad Pro in a March press release, but th launch of its new, lower-cost iPhone may have been delayed on a lack of demand and logistical problems.\\n\\nSharing the wealth\\n\\nApple has donated in excess of $15 million to help support treatment of the sick and mitigate the economic impact of the crisis. This has included substantial donations in Italy.\\n\\nThe company also supports two-to-one corporate matching for any employee donations that relate to coronavirus. The company is presently sourcing and donating millions of masks to health professionals in the U.S. and Europe.\\n\\n\"To every one of the heroes on the front lines, we thank you,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a Tweet.\\n\\nSiri gets smarter\\n\\nSiri can now help you figure out whether you are suffering from COV-19. When you ask it a question such as: \"Do I have the coronavirus?\" you\\'ll be guided through a series of questions to help you answer the question. You\\'ll be advised to stay home or to request further help if your symptoms appear severe.\\n\\nApp Store help\\n\\nThe company is promoting telehealth applications in the App Store when customers ask Siri about coronavirus. It is accelerating the reviews process of COVID-19 applications from reputable sources to help make sure users have the best available information rather than false or misleading information.\\n\\nApple News gets proactive\\n\\nThere are lots of conflicting claims around COV-19. This is confusing and at a time when the global message needs to be utterly clear, Apple News has moved to curate the content it provides. It now provides a COVID-19 news section offering what it calls \"verified\" reporting from what it calls \"trusted news outlets.\"\\n\\nOn iOS and iPad OS devices you\\'ll find a hand-picked set of headlines and links to a detailed coverage page.\\n\\nStaying in? Read a book\\n\\nApple\\'s Books store in the U.S. now offers a small collection of free books (including audiobooks) for adults and children to keep you occupied while remaining isolated.\\n\\nOprah has an Apple TV+ show on the topic\\n\\nOprah has announced a new Apple TV+ show that will focus on the pandemic.\\n\\n\"Oprah Talks COVID-19\" is a new free to view Apple TV+ series featuring remote discussions with leaders and others affected by the disease. Oprah wants to provide insight, meaning and tangible advice to help us through the crisis.\\n\\nApple has closed its retail stores\\n\\nApple closed all its retail stores in China. Those stores are now open, but it has closed its stores everywhere else on the planet.\\n\\nThe idea here is to limit contact between groups of people. Unfortunately, some customers whose devices were being repaired by Apple Geniuses may have been told they can\\'t now pick up their item until the stores open once again.\\n\\nApple has committed that hourly workers will continue to receive pay \"in alignment with business as usual operations.\"\\n\\nAdopt remote working\\n\\nApple has moved to flexible work arrangements worldwide outside of Greater China. It is urging workers to work remotely if they can. It is also urging those who must attend the workplace physically to stay at least two meters apart.\\n\\nThere have been reports that Apple\\'s culture of secrecy is making remote work quite hard to do - but that\\'s only to be expected, and problems have a tendency of getting solved. The company is also deep cleaning all its sites and offices.\\n\\nCaring for employee health\\n\\nApple is introducing new health screenings and temperature checks across all its offices. The company has also moved to accommodate employees who need to take a leave of absence to accommodate personal or family health circumstances created by COVID-19 -- including recovering from an illness, caring for a sick loved one, mandatory quarantining, or childcare challenges due to school closures.\\n\\nPromoting credible information\\n\\nApple is promoting official government information videos via iTunes/Apple Music in the U.S., and also on its home page.\\n\\nReduce bandwidth demands\\n\\nIn line with other streaming media providers, Apple has committed to reducing the resolution of shows streamed through its Apple TV+ network in Europe.\\n\\nCurating podcasting content\\n\\nApple\\'s podcasts app now features a row of reputable Coronavirus-related content. The company is also focusing more on personal development topics through its podcasting service.\\n\\nMaintaining support\\n\\nMacRumors cites an internal memo to Apple Authorized Service Providers in which Apple says its network of authorized repair shops will receive maximum payouts for qualifying product repairs for the months of March and April.\\n\\nApple Card assistance\\n\\nThe consequences of what is taking place are impacting everybody and creating real hardship for many. Apple Card users have been told that if they need help making it through, they can enroll in a new customer assistance program that will allow them to skip their March payments.\\n\\nYou should pay attention\\n\\nApple isn\\'t doing all of these things out of a sudden attack of altruism or as a contribution to some twisted form of April Fool\\'s joke.\\n\\nIt is doing them because it knows we face a global problem that, if left unchecked, will overwhelm global health provision services, cost vast numbers of lives, and generate an economic slow-down akin to the Great Depression, or worse.\\n\\nSome of those consequences may now be unavoidable.\\n\\nCook recently said:\\n\\n\"There is no mistaking the challenge of this moment. The entire Apple family is indebted to the heroic first responders, doctors, nurses, researchers, public health experts and public servants globally who have given every ounce of their spirit to help the world meet this moment. We do not yet know with certainty when the greatest risk will be behind us.\"\\n\\nThat Apple is applying the full extent of its energies in this attempt should make even the greatest cynic wake up to the need to practice social distancing, hide indoors and wash their hands.\\n\\nThose small steps seem the least we can do for medical staff across the entire planet who are even now risking (and in many cases, losing) their own lives on the front line of our struggle against this disease.\\n\\nAre you an Apple, iOS or Mac developer who is offering free services, or augmenting existing ones to help in this struggle? Please drop me a line and I\\'ll let people know.\\n\\nPlease follow me on Twitter, or join me in the AppleHolic\\'s bar & grill and Apple Discussions groups on MeWe.',\n",

       "    'title': 'Apple Pencil on iPad: our full guide on how to use it',\n",
       "    'body': \"An Apple Pencil is one of the best pieces of kit you can buy for your new iPad, to help you make the most of the slate by allowing you to sketch, doodle, annotate, handwrite, and more.\\n\\nThe original Apple Pencil and the Apple Pencil 2, released in 2015 and 2018 respectively, let you replace your wobbly finger with a slender and accurate stylus, which is vital for many creatives and workers alike.\\n\\nIf you're considering buying an Apple Pencil, or have one and want to know how to make the most of it, then this guide is for you, as it includes everything you need to know about the Apple Pencil.\\n\\nYou can pick up an Apple Pencil from Apple's website, and we'd recommend doing so as it's often the same price there as at third-party retailers, but you can get the Apple Pencil 2 engraved there for free.\\n\\nThe original Apple Pencil will cost you $99 / £89 / AU$145, while the Apple Pencil 2 is slightly pricer at $129 / £119 / AU$199. However, the styluses are compatible with different tablets, as we'll get into, so picking the right Apple Pencil for you isn't just about choosing the one in your price range.\\n\\nThe choice of which Apple Pencil you should buy is easy: if you have a 2018-model iPad Pro 11 or iPad Pro 12.9, you should check out the Apple Pencil 2, but the original stylus is compatible with older iPad Pro models as well as a range of newer iPads in other ranges. You can see a full compatibility list here.\\n\\nThere are a few major differences between the newer and older Apple Pencils. The Apple Pencil 2 snaps to the side of your iPad magnetically, and charges wirelessly when it's in position, so it's very easy to use. On the other hand, the original Apple Pencil charges when plugged in to the tablet, so it's far more fiddly to power up.\\n\\nThe Apple Pencil 2 also has a double-tap function, so in certain apps you can quickly press the lower portion of the stylus twice to switch back to the previous tool you were using. This double-tap feature can also be set to show the color palette or activate the eraser.\\n\\nThere are rumors that Apple is working on an Apple Pencil 3 for its new iPad Pro 2020 models. We're not totally sure if this is correct, since the Apple Pencil 2 has only so far been compatible with two tablets compared to eight for the original, but it's certainly possible.\\n\\nOne rumor suggested there could be a touch-sensitive panel on the side of the next stylus, that would let you swipe in directions to access certain tools or, for example, scroll through web pages. The same rumor also posited that there could be a camera on the Apple Pencil 3, though we're not exactly sure what purpose that would serve.\\n\\nWe've also heard the Apple Pencil 3 could have haptic feedback, which means the stylus would vibrate or shake to tell you certain things. It could also detect how hard you're gripping it, so squeezing it would trigger certain functions.\\n\\nIf you've bought an Apple Pencil and want to know how to make the most of it, here are some tips and guides on how to properly work the stylus.\\n\\nCompared to some other peripherals like headphones or wearables, an Apple Pencil is super easy to connect to your slate, as your iPad will do most of the work automatically.\\n\\nFirst of all, make sure Bluetooth is enabled on your iPad, otherwise the stylus won't work. To do this, head into the main settings menu, or pull down the Control Center, and turn Bluetooth on if it isn't on already.\\n\\nNow, for the original Apple Pencil, remove the cap at the end to reveal the Lightning Connector and plug this into the Lightning Port on your iPad. For the Apple Pencil 2, simply connect the stylus to the magnetic strip on your iPad Pro.\\n\\nThe Apple Pencil 2 will pair automatically, but for the original you need to tap a prompt first. Now you're all set up.\\n\\nIt's worth pointing out that with the original Apple Pencil if you turn off the iPad, enter Airplane Mode, or connect the Apple Pencil to a different iPad, you will need to go through this pairing process again.\\n\\nOnce you've paired your Apple Pencil to your iPad you'll want to charge it, but that's very easy - simply leave your Apple Pencil plugged in (for the original) or mounted on the magnetic strip (for the Pencil 2) and the stylus will power up.\\n\\nThe original Apple Pencil also comes with an adapter that lets you connect it to your iPad charger if you'd prefer.\\n\\nCharging is pretty quick, so the Apple Pencil won't be out of action for long at all. When you connect the stylus, the iPad should inform you as to how much battery is left, so you should know if you just need to power the stylus up for a few minutes or for a longer period of time.\\n\\nIf you're new to the Apple Pencil, or stylus gadgets in general, there are a few things to know that could really help you use the Apple Pencil.\\n\\nIt's worth knowing for example that you don't need to press too hard with the stylus onto the screen for inputs to be picked up - in fact, the iPad understands how hard you're pressing, and many sketching apps and the like will therefore adjust the mark left depending on the amount of pressure. But for general note-taking a light touch is all that's needed, and will help protect the screen.\\n\\nIf you've got the original Apple Pencil, we should warn you that charging it can be precarious - since it needs to stick out from the iPad at a right angle, with just a small Lightning connector sticking in.\\n\\nWe'd therefore recommend placing your iPad down flat on a surface while the stylus charges, to avoid you knocking the Apple Pencil and snapping the connector. Or take the iPad out of the equation and use the supplied adapter for charging.\\n\\nYou should also know that when you're using the Apple Pencil, it won't work for all functions on the device. Swiping up from bottom to bring up recent apps, or from the top to bring down the Control Center, for example, will still only work with your finger. This is actually pretty useful, as it will stop you accidentally triggering the wrong function if you draw to the edge of the screen with the stylus.\\n\\nIf you've bought an Apple Pencil and want to know the best apps to use with it, we've got a few suggestions beyond the built-in Notes app. The following apps will let you explore its functions fully.\\n\\nScriptation\\n\\nScriptation is primarily an app that lets you mark up scripts (hence the name), but it's actually a really useful app for annotating all kinds of files, whether they're documents to sign or scrutinize, or articles to analyze. There's a wide range of tools to use, and it's easy to import and export PDFs too.\\n\\nYou won't need sticky notes if you've got Cardflow, as it does the same thing but digitally. You can create a wall of plain or colored pads, and scribble all the notes and information you need on them. It's a super quick and easy way of organizing ideas, made even easier with the Apple Pencil to write and organize with.\\n\\nIt's always useful to have a great art app, for if you're feeling creative or just want a vibrant way of taking notes, and Autodesk SketchBook is one of the best. It has got a huge range of art tools, and also has a user interface that feels specially built for Apple Pencil use, with functions in all the right places.\",\n",

       "    'title': 'The 24 most expensive products Apple has ever sold',\n",
       "    'body': 'Even though Apple has launched more affordable products in recent years, like the $700 iPhone 11 and $329 iPad, the company still a reputation for selling premium, high-end products.\\n\\nThe $1,000 iPhone 11 Pro may seem expensive, especially considering new data shows that most people aren\\'t willing to spend that much money on a new smartphone. But Apple\\'s history is filled with products that are priced much higher than its new top-of-the-line smartphones.\\n\\nWe took a look back on some of the most expensive products that Apple has ever offered.\\n\\nNick Vega contributed to an earlier version of this report.\\n\\nApple\\'s iPhone 11 may be cheaper than 2018\\'s iPhone XS and XR, but its top-of-the-line iPhone will still cost you a pretty penny. The highest configuration of Apple\\'s iPhone 11 Pro Max, which comes with 512 GB of storage, will cost $1,450.\\n\\nThe iPhone 11 Pro Max is the larger version of Apple\\'s high-end iPhone. It has a 6.5-inch screen, compared to the standard iPhone 11 Pro\\'s 5.8-inch screen, and a triple-lens camera unlike the $700 iPhone 11.\\n\\nApple\\'s iPhone XS Max was priced similarly when it launched in 2018.\\n\\nThe Apple Watch Hermès edition, which was designed in partnership with the French fashion brand, will cost you $1,500 if you opt for the stainless steel version with the Single Tour Deployment buckle that supports both GPS and cellular connectivity. The Apple Watch Hermès collection is a line of Apple Watches that come with special cases, bands, and watch faces that Apple and Hermes created together.\\n\\nApple\\'s largest and most powerful iPad costs nearly $2,000. That\\'s if you opt for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, which has a screen that\\'s almost as large as a 13-inch laptop, configured with 1 TB of storage space and cellular connectivity in addition to W-Fi.\\n\\nThe Apple III provided an update to the company\\'s lucrative Apple II line of computers. The Apple III was advertised as twice as fast as and having twice the memory of its predecessor.\\n\\nThe Apple III went for $3,815 with the monitor included. This line of computers was discontinued in 1984, after just four years, with only 65,000 units sold in total.\\n\\nThe Macintosh XL was actually first named the Lisa 2/10, because it borrowed much of the technologies from the Lisa computer. But when it went to market, the Mac XL was branded as the \"first high-end Macintosh.\"\\n\\nThe Macintosh XL was made available as a free upgrade to owners of the first-generation Lisa, but those who didn\\'t own a Lisa model paid up to $3,995 for the Macintosh XL.\\n\\nThe SE/30 was the second generation of Mac\\'s compact computers, providing a smaller version of the Mac IIx, but with more power. With a hard drive, the SE/30 cost $4,900.\\n\\nApple\\'s Pro Display for its new Mac Pro measures 32 inches and boasts a 6016 x 3384 Retina 6K display. The screen is more than 40% larger than that of Apple\\'s Retina 5K display, and the company claims its polarizer technology should deliver accurate colors even when viewing the display off-axis.\\n\\nThis Mac IIcx was a successor to the Mac IIx model, except the IIcx was smaller than the previous model. The IIcx had a modular design so the Mac could be more easily manufactured and put together, which Apple executive Jean-Louis Gassée demonstrated by assembling one live on stage.\\n\\nThe Mac II was actually the first Apple computer with a modular design, and was the first in a line of modular design versions to come. It was also the first Mac with color, which could be added using a graphics card.\\n\\nThough the version running a floppy disk system was lower in price at $3,898, the Mac II with a 40 MB hard drive cost $5,498.\\n\\nNicknamed \"Kanga,\" this portable computer helped to launch several generations of G3s to come (like the Wallstreet and Pismo models).\\n\\nIt was only on the market for six months before it was replaced by its more powerful successors.\\n\\nThe Quadra 700 is the first Apple computer to be housed in a tower-like, vertical-situated case. Before, Apple\\'s computers adhered to a form where the computer would be positioned as a base for the monitor to stand on.\\n\\nApple\\'s new MacBook Pro comes with a larger 16-inch screen, improved speakers and faster performance. It starts at $2,400, but if you opt for the most expensive model that comes with an 8-core processor, 64GB of memory, AMD Radeon Pro 5500M graphics with 8GB of memory, and eight terabytes of storage, you\\'ll end up paying $6,099.\\n\\nAt the time of release, the PowerBook 3400c was advertised as the world\\'s \"fastest notebook computer.\" Its speed was comparable to some of the desktop Mac computers at the time, which was a rarity.\\n\\nThe draw of the Apple LaserWriter was that it could be shared by over a dozen Macintosh computers. This ability made the $7,000 price tag - nearly $16,000 today - a bit easier to swallow for businesses that ran on Macintosh.\\n\\nThe LaserWriter was one of the very first laser printers available on the mass-market, and it helped usher in the desktop publishing revolution.\\n\\nIn September 1989, Apple unveiled its first \"portable\" computer. I put \"portable\" in quotes because although the computer wasn\\'t connected to the wall by a cord, it still weighed a back-breaking 16 pounds - not unlike schlepping around an enormous bowling ball.\\n\\nFor the privilege of being able to lug around this machine, the company asked only that you write them a check for $7,300 - about $14,300 today.\\n\\nThe Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh - or TAM, as those in the know called it - was a truly unique piece of technology. It was released in March 1997, but despite not fitting into any Apple product line, it was the prehistoric ancestor of the modern-day iMac, with all the components held in a slim body behind the screen.\\n\\nWhat set it apart from the pack was that it was significantly more expensive than any other Apple offering at the time. The TAM could be had for $7,500, which would be about $11,200 today.\\n\\nHowever, in a little less than a year, the price got slashed to $1,995 to clear stock. When the TAM was finally sold out, it was discontinued.\\n\\nThe Mac IIci came after the IIcx, providing more power and RAM to the desktop computer. The design was also a bit sleeker than its predecessor.\\n\\nThe IIx came out in 1988 as an update to the original Macintosh II, meaning that this computer powered a color display as well. At the time of its release, Apple lauded the IIx as a computer that would \"reinforce our position in key business and higher education markets.\"\\n\\nIf you were to max out Apple\\'s high-end workstation computer from 2013, it would have cost you a whopping $9,599 the year it launched, as Macworld pointed out. That configuration would include a 12-core processor with 64GB of memory.\\n\\nIf you saw Aaron Sorkin\\'s 2015 biopic \"Steve Jobs,\" you\\'ll likely remember the Apple LISA. Jobs, played by Michael Fassbender, spends most of the movie saying the computer wasn\\'t named after his daughter Lisa, until he finally admits it was.\\n\\nWhat the movie doesn\\'t spend too much time on is the fact that the LISA cost a whopping $9,995 in 1985. For those keeping score at home, that means the LISA would cost just over $24,000 today, after inflation.\\n\\nFor that price, buyers in 1985 were getting a true technical pioneer - the LISA was the first mouse-operated computer to have a graphical user interface system.\\n\\nBy the time the IIfx was released in 1990, Apple had been making computers for 14 years and had sold 15 different models before this one. Apple marketed the computer as an ultra-fast system that could make an impact in the \"workplace market,\" but the IIfx lagged behind other PC computers in existence at the time.\\n\\nIts intention to a be computer for the workplace led Apple to price the IIfx at $9,780, running upwards to $12,000.\\n\\nApple\\'s most expensive computer is aimed at those who need crazy amounts of computing power - such as audio and video editors, and software developers.\\n\\nThe iMac Pro with its default configurations is already impressive, and costs $4,999. But maxing out the computer\\'s upgraded features will put the iMac Pro at $13,199.\\n\\nThe Apple Watch hit stores in 2015 with the somewhat-reasonable price of $349 for the baseline model. Watch collectors, however, are not usually known for paying somewhat-reasonable prices for things. You see, a nice watch is as much a statement piece as it is a time-telling device.\\n\\nApple was more than happy to scratch that itch for collectors, announcing a version of the Apple Watch, called \"Edition.\" The price started at $10,000 for a watch with rose gold casing, and went as high as $17,000 for one that came with an 18-karat yellow or rose gold case and clasps.\\n\\nIt soon became apparent to Apple that most people - other than Beyonce - had no interest in a smartwatch that cost as much as a car. By the time the Apple Watch Series 2 rolled around, the Apple Watch Edition was given a ceramic casing, was being marketed as a fitness device rather than a style piece, and topped out at $1,300. Apple discontinued the Edition altogether last fall.\\n\\nThe newest version of Apple\\'s Mac Pro is a powerhouse of a computer that starts at roughly $6,000, but goes all the way up to $52,000 if you max it out with the highest specifications. That top-of-the-line model includes a beefy 28-core Intel Xeon processor, 1.5 terabytes of memory, two Radeon Pro Vega II Duo graphics processing units, and four terabytes of storage. As is the case with its predecessor, the Mac Pro is designed for professionals in need of a computer than can manage very heavy workflows, like film editors and video game developers, rather than the average person.',\n",

       "    'title': 'The 24 most expensive products Apple has ever sold',\n",
       "    'body': 'Even though Apple has launched more affordable products in recent years, like the $700 iPhone 11 and $329 iPad, the company still a reputation for selling premium, high-end products.\\n\\nThe $1,000 iPhone 11 Pro may seem expensive, especially considering new data shows that most people aren\\'t willing to spend that much money on a new smartphone. But Apple\\'s history is filled with products that are priced much higher than its new top-of-the-line smartphones.\\n\\nWe took a look back on some of the most expensive products that Apple has ever offered.\\n\\nNick Vega contributed to an earlier version of this report.\\n\\nApple\\'s iPhone 11 may be cheaper than 2018\\'s iPhone XS and XR, but its top-of-the-line iPhone will still cost you a pretty penny. The highest configuration of Apple\\'s iPhone 11 Pro Max, which comes with 512 GB of storage, will cost $1,450.\\n\\nThe iPhone 11 Pro Max is the larger version of Apple\\'s high-end iPhone. It has a 6.5-inch screen, compared to the standard iPhone 11 Pro\\'s 5.8-inch screen, and a triple-lens camera unlike the $700 iPhone 11.\\n\\nApple\\'s iPhone XS Max was priced similarly when it launched in 2018.\\n\\nThe Apple Watch Hermès edition, which was designed in partnership with the French fashion brand, will cost you $1,500 if you opt for the stainless steel version with the Single Tour Deployment buckle that supports both GPS and cellular connectivity. The Apple Watch Hermès collection is a line of Apple Watches that come with special cases, bands, and watch faces that Apple and Hermes created together.\\n\\nApple\\'s largest and most powerful iPad costs nearly $2,000. That\\'s if you opt for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, which has a screen that\\'s almost as large as a 13-inch laptop, configured with 1 TB of storage space and cellular connectivity in addition to W-Fi.\\n\\nThe Apple III provided an update to the company\\'s lucrative Apple II line of computers. The Apple III was advertised as twice as fast as and having twice the memory of its predecessor.\\n\\nThe Apple III went for $3,815 with the monitor included. This line of computers was discontinued in 1984, after just four years, with only 65,000 units sold in total.\\n\\nThe Macintosh XL was actually first named the Lisa 2/10, because it borrowed much of the technologies from the Lisa computer. But when it went to market, the Mac XL was branded as the \"first high-end Macintosh.\"\\n\\nThe Macintosh XL was made available as a free upgrade to owners of the first-generation Lisa, but those who didn\\'t own a Lisa model paid up to $3,995 for the Macintosh XL.\\n\\nThe SE/30 was the second generation of Mac\\'s compact computers, providing a smaller version of the Mac IIx, but with more power. With a hard drive, the SE/30 cost $4,900.\\n\\nApple\\'s Pro Display for its new Mac Pro measures 32 inches and boasts a 6016 x 3384 Retina 6K display. The screen is more than 40% larger than that of Apple\\'s Retina 5K display, and the company claims its polarizer technology should deliver accurate colors even when viewing the display off-axis.\\n\\nThis Mac IIcx was a successor to the Mac IIx model, except the IIcx was smaller than the previous model. The IIcx had a modular design so the Mac could be more easily manufactured and put together, which Apple executive Jean-Louis Gassée demonstrated by assembling one live on stage.\\n\\nThe Mac II was actually the first Apple computer with a modular design, and was the first in a line of modular design versions to come. It was also the first Mac with color, which could be added using a graphics card.\\n\\nThough the version running a floppy disk system was lower in price at $3,898, the Mac II with a 40 MB hard drive cost $5,498.\\n\\nNicknamed \"Kanga,\" this portable computer helped to launch several generations of G3s to come (like the Wallstreet and Pismo models).\\n\\nIt was only on the market for six months before it was replaced by its more powerful successors.\\n\\nThe Quadra 700 is the first Apple computer to be housed in a tower-like, vertical-situated case. Before, Apple\\'s computers adhered to a form where the computer would be positioned as a base for the monitor to stand on.\\n\\nApple\\'s new MacBook Pro comes with a larger 16-inch screen, improved speakers and faster performance. It starts at $2,400, but if you opt for the most expensive model that comes with an 8-core processor, 64GB of memory, AMD Radeon Pro 5500M graphics with 8GB of memory, and eight terabytes of storage, you\\'ll end up paying $6,099.\\n\\nAt the time of release, the PowerBook 3400c was advertised as the world\\'s \"fastest notebook computer.\" Its speed was comparable to some of the desktop Mac computers at the time, which was a rarity.\\n\\nThe draw of the Apple LaserWriter was that it could be shared by over a dozen Macintosh computers. This ability made the $7,000 price tag - nearly $16,000 today - a bit easier to swallow for businesses that ran on Macintosh.\\n\\nThe LaserWriter was one of the very first laser printers available on the mass-market, and it helped usher in the desktop publishing revolution.\\n\\nIn September 1989, Apple unveiled its first \"portable\" computer. I put \"portable\" in quotes because although the computer wasn\\'t connected to the wall by a cord, it still weighed a back-breaking 16 pounds - not unlike schlepping around an enormous bowling ball.\\n\\nFor the privilege of being able to lug around this machine, the company asked only that you write them a check for $7,300 - about $14,300 today.\\n\\nThe Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh - or TAM, as those in the know called it - was a truly unique piece of technology. It was released in March 1997, but despite not fitting into any Apple product line, it was the prehistoric ancestor of the modern-day iMac, with all the components held in a slim body behind the screen.\\n\\nWhat set it apart from the pack was that it was significantly more expensive than any other Apple offering at the time. The TAM could be had for $7,500, which would be about $11,200 today.\\n\\nHowever, in a little less than a year, the price got slashed to $1,995 to clear stock. When the TAM was finally sold out, it was discontinued.\\n\\nThe Mac IIci came after the IIcx, providing more power and RAM to the desktop computer. The design was also a bit sleeker than its predecessor.\\n\\nThe IIx came out in 1988 as an update to the original Macintosh II, meaning that this computer powered a color display as well. At the time of its release, Apple lauded the IIx as a computer that would \"reinforce our position in key business and higher education markets.\"\\n\\nIf you were to max out Apple\\'s high-end workstation computer from 2013, it would have cost you a whopping $9,599 the year it launched, as Macworld pointed out. That configuration would include a 12-core processor with 64GB of memory.\\n\\nIf you saw Aaron Sorkin\\'s 2015 biopic \"Steve Jobs,\" you\\'ll likely remember the Apple LISA. Jobs, played by Michael Fassbender, spends most of the movie saying the computer wasn\\'t named after his daughter Lisa, until he finally admits it was.\\n\\nWhat the movie doesn\\'t spend too much time on is the fact that the LISA cost a whopping $9,995 in 1985. For those keeping score at home, that means the LISA would cost just over $24,000 today, after inflation.\\n\\nFor that price, buyers in 1985 were getting a true technical pioneer - the LISA was the first mouse-operated computer to have a graphical user interface system.\\n\\nBy the time the IIfx was released in 1990, Apple had been making computers for 14 years and had sold 15 different models before this one. Apple marketed the computer as an ultra-fast system that could make an impact in the \"workplace market,\" but the IIfx lagged behind other PC computers in existence at the time.\\n\\nIts intention to a be computer for the workplace led Apple to price the IIfx at $9,780, running upwards to $12,000.\\n\\nApple\\'s most expensive computer is aimed at those who need crazy amounts of computing power - such as audio and video editors, and software developers.\\n\\nThe iMac Pro with its default configurations is already impressive, and costs $4,999. But maxing out the computer\\'s upgraded features will put the iMac Pro at $13,199.\\n\\nThe Apple Watch hit stores in 2015 with the somewhat-reasonable price of $349 for the baseline model. Watch collectors, however, are not usually known for paying somewhat-reasonable prices for things. You see, a nice watch is as much a statement piece as it is a time-telling device.\\n\\nApple was more than happy to scratch that itch for collectors, announcing a version of the Apple Watch, called \"Edition.\" The price started at $10,000 for a watch with rose gold casing, and went as high as $17,000 for one that came with an 18-karat yellow or rose gold case and clasps.\\n\\nIt soon became apparent to Apple that most people - other than Beyonce - had no interest in a smartwatch that cost as much as a car.

As is the case with its predecessor, the Mac Pro is designed for professionals in need of a computer than can manage very heavy workflows, like film editors and video game developers, rather than the average person.',\n",

       "    'body': \"The next Apple Watch, likely called Apple Watch Series 6, is coming this Fall, we think. Here are all the latest rumors about what to expect.\\n\\nApple Watch Series 5. What will Series 6 look like?\\n\\nApple\\n\\nApple Watch Series 6 is coming. Itll likely be this Fall, unless the current health considerations knock the schedule out of whack. So, what will the successor to the current Apple Watch Series 5 be like? What will be its new features, its design, its price? Read on for all the latest rumors. And please check back: Ill be updating this post regularly.\\n\\nApple iOS 13.4 Can't Come Soon Enough. Here's Why.\\n\\nForbesDavid PhelanWhen? Whatll it be called? And how much?\\n\\nIf the world is anywhere back to normal by this Fall, Id expect the next Apple Watch to be released in or about the second week of September.\\n\\nPricing will almost certainly be the same as the current flagship, the Apple Watch Series 5, that is from $399 for the smaller size and from $429 for the larger.\\n\\nNote, though, that Apple Watch Series 3 is currently available from a remarkably low price from $199 for the 38mm case, from $229 for the 42mm. Apple could choose to keep it in the range, but what it cant do is reduce the price of the Watch that followed it, Series 4, because that vanished when Series 5 appeared.\\n\\nAs for how to call it, Apple Watch Series 6 is the most likely name.\\n\\nThe latest rumors: Better health monitoring\\n\\nBlood oxygen saturation monitoring is the most recent suggestion, from a slew of revelations found in a leaked version of iOS 14. A new health notification is coming, it seems, to indicated blood oxygen levels. Oxygen levels should be 95% or above. When it falls below 80%, its unhealthy. This notification will work alongside warnings of unusual heart rate levels.\\n\\nWill Apple Watch Series 6 improve ECG measurements?\\n\\nApple\\n\\nThe latest rumors: ECG improvements\\n\\nThe Series 4 and Series 5 Apple Watch models introduced ECG measurements, but when heart rates hit over 100 beats per minute, up to 120bpm. Apple is fixing this, its rumored, so that the next watchOS will address it. This may or may not require new hardware.\\n\\nApple Watch faces could be about to be even better.\\n\\nApple\\n\\nThe latest rumors: shareable Watch faces\\n\\nIf youve ever seen a Watch face you like on someone elses Apple Watch, mimicking it perfectly can be trickier than it seems. If the faces were shareable, in the exact configuration youre so taken with, well, that would be great. Its not yet clear whether this would be shared direct from one Watch to another or via an iPhone. Its still not the third-party Watch face support many have been asking for, of course.\\n\\nApple iPad 2020 And iPad Pro 2020: All We Know So Far\\n\\nForbesDavid PhelanThe latest rumors: Tachymeter\\n\\nA tachymeter is a dial that will be familiar to many analogue watch wearers. Its designed to measure speed based on travel time, for instance, or to calculate distance based on speed. For example, say you drive for 1 mile and it takes 35 seconds. The tachymeter dial next to where the second hand is pointing, shows 103. This means youve been running at a rate equivalent to 103 miles per hour. In which case, slow down, please.\\n\\nThe next Apple Watch, it seems, will have a new version of the popular Infograph Watch face, perhaps called Infograph Pro, with an onscreen tachymeter framing the dial.\\n\\nThe latest rumors: Parental controls\\n\\nRight now, you can use one iPhone to set up multiple Apple Watches, but only one can be active at a time. With the next software, more than one can be in use at once. So, a parent can activate an Apple Watch for their child, but wont need a separate iPhone for that child. Parental controls will mean the parent can control what music is available on the childs Watch and which apps or even complications are available at certain times, so during school hours there are fewer distracting apps available.\\n\\nNew Apple Watch, new Watch bands.\\n\\nApple\\n\\nThe latest rumors: Sleep tracking\\n\\nThe iOS 14 leak suggests that (at last!) sleep tracking will be coming to the next version of Apple Watch.\\n\\nMy guess is that it wasnt introduced last time on Apple Watch Series 5 because battery optimization needed to be improved. After all, you either need a longer battery life or a battery that recharges more quickly to feel confident about wearing the Apple Watch all day and all night. In fact, the battery is probably good enough already, but theres a perception issue that needs to be addressed.\\n\\nDesign\\n\\nThe Apple Watch comes in four metal finishes: aluminum and stainless steel, plus two more metals in Apple Watch Edition: ceramic and titanium. Its not clear whether titanium and ceramic will both be part of the 2020 range, but its a shoo-in that aluminum and stainless steel will.\\n\\nWhether the design will change is less clear. After all, there was such a major change with Series 4, its likely that Series 6 will closely follow the current look, Id say.\\n\\nCould there be a PRODUCT(RED) Apple Watch?\\n\\nMacG via WatchGeneration\\n\\nApple Watch PRODUCT(RED)\\n\\nPerhaps before we get to Series 6, there may be one more Series 5 Watch to come, a PRODUCT(RED) version which helps raise money to help people with HIV/AIDS. If that happens, then a PRODUCT(RED) Apple Watch Series 6 could be on the cards, too. Perhaps from the expected September release date.\\n\\nApple Won't Hold A March Event And Now WWDC Is Modified By Coronavirus\\n\\nForbesDavid PhelanFaster performance\\n\\nAlthough the difference between the S5 chip in Series 5 and the S4 chip from the year before is mostly the addition of a compass and the driver for the different-technology display on the latest Watch, this year it seems bigger changes are afoot.\\n\\nAnalyst Ming-Chi Kuo from TF International Securities. Kuo predicts that a new material used in the circuit boards may lead to performance improvements, which could also help with battery life, of course.\\n\\nThe report also suggested there could be improved wireless transmission from this change, too.\\n\\nWater resistance\\n\\nThat improved circuit board could also mean the next Apple Watch can survive when submerged to greater depths. You can use the current model underwater to a depth of 5ATM, thats 50 meters. Thats enough for most people. Its possible that water-skiing or even scuba diving could be doable with Apple Watch Series 6.\\n\\nAnd before the new Watch, there'll likely be a new Pride Watch strap.\\n\\nApple\\n\\nMicroLED display\\n\\nThis has been a rumor for years now. Given the switch to a new display technology on the Apple Watch Series 5, Id be astonished if Apple switched to a whole other display so soon.\\n\\nI think MicroLED will come, but I think well be waiting until 2021 at the earliest.\\n\\nFace ID\\n\\nRumors have been flying that a camera could be added to an Apple Watch. In turn, this may mean Face ID is included on a future Apple Watch.\\n\\nIm not sure about this as it would take up significant real estate to fit a True Depth sensor on to a Watch. This is a rumor Im taking with a pinch of salt.\\n\\nIll be updating this post as new rumors and reports emerge, so please bookmark this page or check back.\\n\\n_________________________\\n\\nFollow me on Instagram by clicking here:davidphelantechand Twitter:@davidphelan2009\\n\\nMore on Forbes\\n\\nThe Next Apple iPhone Software Could Boast A Radical New Feature\\n\\nForbesDavid Phelan_________________________\",\n",

       "    'title': 'AirPods, Beats, and the best Apple headphones you can buy in 2020',\n",
       "    'body': 'Apple headphones used to be restricted to the wired EarPods you\\'ll find in the box of a new iPhone, but these days the tech giant is well on its way to becoming a credible audio brand that can stand up to the likes of Sony and Bose.\\n\\nThat\\'s partly down to its acquisition of Dr Dre\\'s Beats headphones in 2014, which expanded Apple\\'s portfolio to include colorful, fashion-forward on-ear headphones, wireless over-ear headphones, and slick running earbuds.\\n\\nThen, in 2016, the company brought out the Apple AirPods, and in doing so, thrust true wireless earbuds into the mainstream. While the AirPods - which were upgraded in 2019 with Apple\\'s H1 chip - are by no means the best true wireless earbuds you can buy, they\\'re undeniably iconic, with their long stems and all-white design. Beats followed suit with the Powerbeats Pro, which came with a sports-ready earhook design and pumping bass.\\n\\nIn late 2019, Apple stepped up its true wireless game with the AirPods Pro, which brought noise cancelation, better sound, and a sleek design to its cord-cutting earbuds - that\\'s why you\\'ll find them at the top of our guide to the best Apple headphones.\\n\\nDespite their popularity, none of Apple\\'s models are the best headphones you can buy in 2020, but the promise of new models means that the company could prove an even bigger rival to its largest competitors.\\n\\nThis year, we\\'re expecting to see the first pair of Apple over-ear headphones, as well as an entry-level version of the AirPods Pro (the so-called AirPods Pro Lite), and a new pair of wireless neckbuds, the Powerbeats 4.\\n\\nFor now, here are the best Apple headphones you can currently buy - but expect this list to grow larger throughout 2020 as more models are released.\\n\\nAcoustic design: Closed | Weight: 5.4g | Frequency response: 20-20,000Hz | Drivers: N/A | Driver type: Dynamic | Sensitivity: N/A | Impedance: N/A | Battery life (on-board): Up to 5 hours | Battery life (charging case): 24 hours | Wireless range: N/A | NFC: Yes\\n\\nApple\\'s best headphones of 2020, the AirPods Pro, bring active noise cancellation, a much better fit, and an improved design to the company\\'s previous true wireless earbuds.\\n\\nThey\\'re not quite the best true wireless earbuds out there (that honor goes to the Sony WF-1000XM3), and at $249 / £249 / AU$399 they aren\\'t cheap, either.\\n\\nThat said, if you\\'re an iPhone user looking for some well-fitting earbuds with strong sound quality, you could do a lot worse than the latest AirPods - the redesign means they\\'re far less likely to fall out, and the additional microphones provide strong noise-cancelling (particularly when commuting), as well as a useful Transparency mode, which really does let the outside world in.\\n\\nThe sound quality of the AirPods Pro has certainly improved since the previous iteration - there\\'s a notable emphasis on vocals and bass, meaning these earbuds are better for pop fans than those who enjoy a more natural presentation that lends itself to classical music or more orchestral sounds.\\n\\nApparently, there\\'s a new AirPods model on the horizon to join the original buds and the newer Pros. The AirPods Pro Lite are rumored to be a new, cheaper variant of the company\\'s popular true wireless earbuds, and they could be released this year.\\n\\nBringing top-notch adaptive noise cancelling to its on-ear offering for the first time, Beats Solo Pro is a marked step up from its previous iterations - particularly when it comes to build quality.\\n\\nSturdier than the Beats Solo 3 and sporting a cool matte finish in each color, the Beats Solo Pro feel like the biggest step up in quality the series has seen in some time for its larger line of headphones. Like the 2019 AirPods and AirPods Pro, they come with the H1 chip which allows for fast pairing and hands-free Siri integration.\\n\\nPriced at $299.95 (£269.95 / AU$429.95 / NZ$499.95), the Solo Pro will likely appeal most to users who want a great pair of Beats cans without committing to Apple\\'s bulkier, pricier over-ear option, the Beats Studio 3 Wireless.\\n\\nThe active noise-cancelation brings Apple\\'s Beats somewhat closer to the best offerings from Sony and Bose, although those two are still ahead by some distance - the Sony WH-1000XM3 and the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 are our top two picks in this field.\\n\\nWe do like the simple-one button access to the transparency mode here, though. This optional feature allows some outside noise to come through, which can be handy in an office if you want to be aware of someone calling your name or making sure you\\'re aware of traffic around you when walking or cycling.\\n\\nThe PowerBeats Pro true wireless earbuds are something special - they\\'re supremely comfortable, sound decent and seem to never, ever fall out.\\n\\nThey might not be the best true wireless earbuds in Apple\\'s audio arsenal now that the AirPods Pro are here, but they are Apple\\'s most premium play into the world of running headphones, and are the buds we\\'d recommend to most workout enthusiasts.\\n\\nThat\\'s thanks to features like the pressure-reducing micro-laser barometric venting hole, their long on-board battery life and good sound quality. If we had to choose between wearing these and the original AirPods around the house or office, these are what we\\'d wear.\\n\\nWith an over-ear, closed back design, the Studio 3 are among the best noise-cancelling headphones Beats has ever made.\\n\\nThe battery has massively improved since previous models too, so you can enjoy music for up to 22 hours, or 40 with the active noise cancellation turned off - just like the Beats Solo Pro.\\n\\nHowever, there are sound issues you just don\\'t hear in other good headphones at the price. It\\'s not boomy bass but a tire of blubber sitting between the bass and mids that makes the Beats Studio 3 Wireless less articulate and open-sounding than most alternatives.\\n\\nStill, they\\'re a good match for iPhones missing 3.5mm jacks - in fact, you can pair them with any smartphone thanks to the Bluetooth technology. The Studio 3s are available in multiple colors too, including red, matte black, white, porcelain rose, blue and shadow grey.\\n\\n2019 was a big year for the Apple AirPods; in March last year, the true wireless earbuds were given an upgrade to give us the new AirPods, and most recently, Apple announced the Apple AirPods Pro.\\n\\nThe second generation Apple AirPods, the AirPods (2019), aren\\'t a huge improvement on their predecessors, but they still sport some cool features, that may make them worth buying if you\\'re an iPhone user in particular.\\n\\nThey still feature the iconic design of the original AirPods, and sound quality hasn\\'t changed at all - it\\'s lively, but not on par with the best true wireless earbuds of 2020. The bulk of the upgrade comes from the new H1 headphone chip, which improves connectivity and battery life, and allows for a new \\'Hey Siri\\' voice activation feature.\\n\\nThe AirPods (2019) also come with an optional wireless charging case means you can use a Qi-compatible charging mat to power the case, rather than sticking a cable into the Lightning charging port in the bottom of the case.\\n\\nLike their predecessors, they are super easy to pair, but they are very much optimized for using with iPhones. The best true wireless earbuds give you more flexibility when it comes to your device of choice, and can offer superior sound quality - as well as sleeker designs.\\n\\nThere\\'s also no getting away from the fact that these are an expensive pair of headphones, and for that kind of money we think that you can find better products elsewhere - especially if you\\'re looking to pair with anything other than an iPhone.\\n\\nThe PowerBeats 3 running headphones are yet another pair of Beats headphones that aim to keep your tunes pumping while you keep your legs pumping. They may come with the high price that is a signature of the Beats and Apple brands, but they offer a lot for runners, and especially for Apple users.\\n\\nWith a 12-hour battery life and a quick charge function that can add an hour of battery life in a few minutes, the PowerBeats 3 should rarely run out of juice in the middle of anything short of an insane ultra-marathon. They\\'re also ready for all the sweat from your brow, and can even handle a run in the rain.\\n\\nThe Beats Powerbeats 4 could be coming soon, too - and they could make perfect running headphones. After some digging around in iOS 13, a new icon for the upcoming buds was discovered, which shows they\\'ll sport the same workout-friendly design as the true wireless Powerbeats Pro.\\n\\nRead more: Beats PowerBeats 3 review\\n\\nAre Apple headphones worth buying? It depends on what you\\'re looking for - if you want easy pairing with your iPhone, you can\\'t go wrong with Apple or Beats headphones. Looking for pure audio fidelity? You\\'re better off looking at competitors like Sony and Bose, though more Apple headphones like the AirPods Pro sound very good indeed.\\n\\nHow much are Apple headphones? Prices vary, but Apple headphones tend to sit at the pricier end of the mid-range. For example, the Beats Powerbeats 3 cost $199.95 / £169.95 / AU$259.95 at launch, while the AirPods Pro cost $249 / £249 / AU$399.\\n\\nCan I work out with Apple headphones? Yes. The best Apple headphones for working out at the Powerbeats Pro, thanks to their earhook design and sweatproof IPX4 rating. Other models, like the AirPods Pro have no such rating, though Apple says that they\\'re water and sweat-resistant.\\n\\nAre AirPods noise-cancelling? The only noise-cancelling AirPods are the AirPods Pro. Otherwise you\\'ll have to look to Beats headphones like the Studio 3 Wireless and the Solo Pro to block out environmental sound.\\n\\nCan AirPods connect to Android phones? Yes, they can. You might find they\\'re marginally slower to pair than they would be with an iPhone, but the difference is negligible. However, if you are using AirPods with an Android, you\\'ll miss out on features like auto-pause or the ability to customize noise cancelation.\\n\\nDo Beats work better with Apple? Again, Apple headphones - and therefore Beats headphones - are designed to work seamlessly with Apple\\'s ecosystem. That doesn\\'t mean you can\\'t use Beats headphones with other operating systems, but you may miss out on some features if you do.\\n\\n2020 is set to be a huge year for Apple headphones. This year, we\\'re expecting to see the first pair of Apple over-ear headphones, the AirPods Pro Lite, and the Powerbeats 4.\\n\\nAccording to a report by respected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who correctly predicted the release of the upgraded Apple AirPods and the AirPods Pro in 2019, the first over-ear Apple headphones will launch alongside a number of new products in the first half of 2020.\\n\\nA March release date is possible, based on previous Apple launches, though icons for the new Apple headphones have been discovered in iOS 14, which is due to release between September and November this year - so we may be waiting a little longer.\\n\\nAn inventory listing from US store Target, may have revealed the price of the hotly-anticipated cans, too. YouTuber Jon Prosser posted an image to Twitter, purporting to show the upcoming over-ear headphones in Target\\'s system, mysteriously listed as \"Apple AirPods (X Generation)\".\\n\\nThe product in the image appears to cost $399, which works out at around £300 / AU$600 - if these are the rumored Apple StudioPods, then the brand is aiming for the higher end of the price scale, surpassing the cost of competitors like the Sony WH-1000XM3 and the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the AirPods Pro Lite will reportedly be an entry-level version of the noise-cancelling AirPods Pro, which suggest the rumored wireless earbuds might be cheaper than the most expensive Apple earbuds currently on the market.\\n\\nRumors have been circling since mid-February, after a report from DigiTimes claimed that the new true wireless earbuds will launch in the first half of 2020.\\n\\nLastly, the Powerbeats 3 could be getting a follow-up in the form of the hotly-anticipated Powerbeats 4 wireless earbuds.\\n\\nThat\\'s based on a US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) filing that depicts a pair of wireless earphones, called \\'Power Beats Wireless\\' awarded to Apple on February 27.\\n\\nWhile Apple hasn\\'t confirmed the existence of the Beats Powerbeats 4 - if that\\'s what they\\'ll be called - FCC filings are usually a good indicator that a product is on the verge of being released.\\n\\nMost recently, we\\'ve seen our first images of the Powerbeats 4; on March 9 WinFuture published what it says are photographs of the new wireless earbuds, along with new information on battery life, design, and support for Siri.',\n",

       "    'body': \"If you look at the top of your Apple Watch's dial, chances are you'll see at least one icon up there, including the infamous 'red dot on Apple Watch'. However, while there are a bunch of icons that the Apple Watch displays on the dial, there are a lot more in places like the Control Center. So if you're just as confused about them as I was when I first started using the Apple Watch, here is your definitive guide to all Apple Watch icon meanings.\\n\\nNote: These icons can be found in watchOS 6, and Apple may or may not add more of these in watchOS 7 when it's released later this fall. We will update this article when (and if) more watchOS icons are added by Apple.\\n\\nThis icon signifies that there are unread notifications on your Apple Watch. Swipe down from the top to access the Notification Center to view them. From within an app, you can long press on the top edge of the screen and then swipe down to get to the Notification Center.\\n\\nThe green flash icon on Apple Watch shows that your Apple Watch is currently charging on its dock.\\n\\nIf you're seeing a red flash icon on your Watch, it means the Apple Watch battery is low. Place your watch on the supplied charging cradle to recharge the battery.\\n\\nThe lock icon appears when your Apple Watch has been locked with a passcode. This happens automatically when you take your watch off your wrist. However, if you have disabled wrist detection, you can lock your Apple Watch from the Control Center.\\n\\nTo unlock, you will have to enter the passcode you set.\\n\\nThis icon only appears in Apple Watch Series 2 and above. It appears when the Water Lock mode is turned on from the Control Center. With this mode, the Apple Watch doesn't respond to touches in order to prevent accidental touches from exposure to water.\\n\\nTo unlock your watch from this mode, rotate the Digital Crown until you hear a series of beeps. This sound also helps clear out water from the Apple Watch's speakers.\\n\\nThe moon icon shows up when Do Not Disturb has been turned on. When you see this icon, it means that calls and alerts will not make a sound or light up the screen. However, the Apple Watch will still ring your alarms.\\n\\nThis icon appears when Airplane Mode is enabled on the Apple Watch. You will not have access to wireless features of the watch, but non wireless functionality remains available.\\n\\nThis icons signifies that Theater Mode is enabled. In this mode, the Apple Watch screen doesn't light up when you receive notifications, and Always on Display is turned off.\\n\\nThe mode is meant to be used in movie theaters in order to not be a distraction, but I've found it to be quite helpful if you're sleeping with your watch on your wrist.\\n\\nThis icon appears when you have a workout in progress. You can tap on this icon to go to the workout tracking screen in order to pause/end the workout.\\n\\nThis icon appears if your Apple Watch (GPS + Cellular) has lost its connection to the cellular network.\\n\\nThis icon appears if your Apple Watch has gotten disconnected from the iPhone it is paired with. Try moving the devices closer together, turning off Airplane Mode if it's enabled, or restarting your watch.\\n\\nThis icon appears in the Control Center while your iPhone is connected to the Apple Watch.\\n\\nThe location indicator shows up when an app has used or is using your location on the Watch. Do note that this indicator also shows up if you're using a watch face that needs access to your location for providing information such as weather details.\\n\\nThis icon appears when the Apple Watch is connected to a WiFi network.\\n\\nThe Wireless Activity icon shows up when a wireless activity is taking place, or an active process is happening.\\n\\nThis mic icon shows up on the Apple Watch when the watch is recording audio in the background.\\n\\nIf you're using a cellular Apple Watch, the LTE icon will show up to signify the signal strength.\\n\\nThe Now Playing icon shows up when there is music playing on your Apple Watch, or on your iPhone. You can tap on this icon to open the Now Playing app and control playback of media.\\n\\nWhen you're on a phone call, either on your iPhone or via the Apple Watch, this icon shows up. You can tap on this icon to get to the call screen.\\n\\nThe Maps icon shows up on the Apple Watch when the Apple Maps app is being used to provide directions.\\n\\nThe navigation icon shows up on the Apple Watch if a third party maps app is providing directions on the watch.\\n\\nThe walkie talkie icon shows up on the Apple Watch when you've enabled Walkie Talkie mode on your watch. The icon signifies that your contacts can contact you via Walkie Talkie.\\n\\nThis icon enables or disables the cellular connection on Apple Watches with eSIM capability.\\n\\nTapping on this icon toggles WiFi on the Apple Watch.\\n\\nThis icon is meant to help find your paired iPhone. Tapping on this makes your iPhone beep loudly so you can locate it.\\n\\nPro-tip: You can long press on this icon to make your iPhone flash its LED while making the sound, making it easier to find in a dark room.\\n\\nThis icon shows the current battery percentage on your Apple Watch. Moreover, tapping on this icon brings up the option to put your watch on 'Power Reserve'\\n\\nTap on this icon to toggle Silent Mode on and off. The icon changes between a regular bell icon, and a crossed out bell icon to signify which mode the Apple Watch is in.\\n\\nTurn on flashlight on your Apple Watch. There are three flashlight modes in the watch. You can choose between them by swiping across the screen.\\n\\nThis icon lets you choose the audio output you want to use with your Apple Watch.\\n\\nThose were all of the icons and symbols you might see in watchOS 6 on your Apple Watch. While a lot of these icons are self-explanatory, some of them are a tad bit more confusing than one would want. Hopefully, this article has helped you understand the meaning of various Apple Watch icons and symbols. If I missed out on any icon, let me know in the comments and I will definitely add it to the list.\",\n",

       "    'title': 'Everything we know so far about the Apple Watch Series 6 - 9to5Mac',\n",
       "    'body': 'The Apple Watch Series 5 was a major update, bringing an always-on display to the device for the first time. This year, early indications are that the Apple Watch Series 6 will continue to expand health capabilities. Read on as we round up everything we know so far about the 2020 Apple Watch.\\n\\nDesign\\n\\nThe Apple Watch Series 6 is likely to look similar to the Apple Watch Series 5. Reports indicate that there aren\\'t any major changes in store for the Apple Watch Series 6\\'s industrial design, and that it will follow the same general form factor as the Series 4 and Series 5.\\n\\nThat being said, it\\'s not out of the question that Apple will offer new finishes, colors, and casing options for the Apple Watch Series 6. With last year\\'s release of the Series 5, Apple debuted an all-new titanium option.\\n\\nWhat\\'s in store for this year? We don\\'t know yet, but possibilities include new colors for existing casing materials, new materials altogether, and much more. And of course, Apple will likely have new band options and colors as well.\\n\\nApple Watch Series 6 health features\\n\\nOne of the tentpole features of this year\\'s Apple Watch update is expected to be blood oxygen level detection. Code found within iOS 14 by 9to5Mac has indicated that Apple Watch will add it this year.\\n\\nHow would this work? Blood oxygen levels between 95% and 100% are considered healthy; blood oxygen levels below 80% may lead to compromised heart and brain functionality. Risk of respiratory or cardiac arrest is common after continued low blood oxygen saturation. This feature would work similar to existing watchOS heart rate notification features. If Apple Watch detects a blood oxygen level below a certain threshold, it will trigger a notification for the user.\\n\\nBuilding on blood oxygen level detection, Apple is also developing improved electrocardiogram (ECG) capabilities for Apple Watch Series 6. Apple Watch Series 4 and 5 currently result in inconclusive ECG readings with heart rates between 100 and 120 beats per minute. A future update, either in software or hardware, will remove that limitation with an upgraded version of the ECG app.\\n\\nAs of right now, it is unclear whether these new health features will be limited to the Apple Watch Series 6 or if watchOS 7 might also bring them to the Apple Watch Series 4/5. History suggests Apple will want to use these features to push upgrades to the Series 6, but we\\'ll have to wait and find out for sure.\\n\\nSleep tracking\\n\\nSleep tracking has been at the top of many Apple Watch wish lists for years, and it appears that 2020 will finally be the year that brings the feature to users. 9to5Mac has reported many of the details on what to expect:\\n\\nWhile asleep, the Apple Watch will track the user\\'s quality of sleep using its multiple sensors and inputs, including the person\\'s movement, heart rate, and noises. Data about the user\\'s quality of sleep will be made available in the Health app and a new Sleep app for the Apple Watch.\\n\\nThe biggest question is how Apple will tackle the battery life issue for Apple Watch sleep tracking. According to 9to5Mac sources, Apple has developed a feature that will remind users to charge their Watch beforehand so they can get through the night.\\n\\nBloomberg has reported that sleep tracking will be tied to new hardware rather than new software. This means that existing Apple Watch users will likely have to upgrade to the Apple Watch Series 6 in order to take advantage of native sleep tracking capabilities.\\n\\nMore watchOS 7 features\\n\\nWhile these are unlikely to be exclusive to the Apple Watch Series 6, 9to5Mac has reported several other details on what to expect from watchOS 7 this year.\\n\\nThis includes a new Infograph Pro watch face that will feature a tachymeter. A tachymeter is an analog watch scale located around the dial that is used to measure speed and distance based on travel time. There will also be new \"International\" Apple Watch faces with country flags.\\n\\nWatchOS 7 will also have numerous new features for parents and kids. For instance, a new feature called SchoolTime will allow parents to manage which apps and complications can be used during certain hours, like class time.\\n\\nCheck out more coverage of watchOS 7 at the links below:\\n\\nwatchOS 7 to include new \\'International\\' Apple Watch face with multiple country flags Apple Watch Series 6 and watchOS 7 to include \\'Infograph Pro\\' with tachymeter, SchoolTime and kids mode, sleep tracking, more iOS 14 code reveals Apple working with BMW on futuristic \\'CarKey\\' iPhone feature Release\\n\\nCurrently, we expect the Apple Watch Series 6 to be announced in September alongside Apple\\'s 2020 lineup of iPhones. That being said, given the current COVID-19 pandemic, product launch timelines are in flux.\\n\\nVarious reports have suggested that the iPhone 12 could be delayed due to COVID-19 and corresponding economic uncertainty. Whether or not the Apple Watch Series 6 might also be affected by these delays remains to be seen.\\n\\nApple Watch Series 6 wrap-up\\n\\nAs of right now, that\\'s all we know so far about the Apple Watch Series 6. As always, it\\'s likely that we\\'ll continue to learn more about the device in the lead-up to its expected release in September.\\n\\nWhat\\'s on your Apple Watch Series 6 wish list? What are you most looking forward to? Let us know down in the comments!\\n\\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.',\n",

       "    'title': \"For iPad, Accessibility Gives 'It's Just a Big iPhone' New Meaning\",\n",
       "    'body': 'Perhaps the most common complaint hurled against the iPad over its first decade of life is that it\\'s little more than a bigger iPhone. At a fundamental level, the criticism is certainly valid: by and large, the iPad runs the same software as the iPhone. The penchant for bemoaning this bigness emanates from discontentment over the fact that substantial improvements to the iPad\\'s software have come at a glacially slow pace. Until last year, meaningful upgrades tailored to the tablet were few and far between. As much as Apple has extolled the iPad for being \"unlike any computer,\" the truth is the product stagnated for quite a while in terms of software. For better or worse, the company has been preoccupied with savoring every last drop of mother\\'s milk from the cash cow that is the iPhone. The iPad was left to wither thirstily when it came to its own growth, and it suffered for some time as a result.\\n\\nIn actuality, the iPad being more or less a scaled-up iPhone isn\\'t necessarily an entirely bad thing. The reason is iOS; familiarity breeds comfort - Apple shrewdly created the iPad\\'s user interface (and to lesser extents, Apple Watch and Apple TV) to largely resemble the iPhone. Especially for less nerdy users, the consistency across devices makes for a seamless, less intimidating experience. From icons to text to features to the touchscreen, the iPad being so similar to the iPhone means acclimating to the device takes minimal time and effort. From an accessibility standpoint, easy acclimation sets the tone for an enjoyable user experience. The foremost reason this is important is that the easier it is to acclimate to a device, the easier it is to find and configure mission-critical accessibility features.\\n\\nThus, it\\'s not at all unreasonable to look at what was heretofore a pejorative assessment - the iPad is nothing but a big iPhone - and turn it into a positive. One of the unheralded aspects of the device\\'s success is how its approachable, intuitive nature has made it a hit in accessibility-centric contexts such as special education classrooms and as a communicative aid. Such advances get right at the heart of the oft-cited Steve Jobs quote on the so-called intersection of technology and the liberal arts, when he said, \"It\\'s in Apple\\'s DNA that technology alone is not enough.\" Assistive technology obviously caters to the humanities part of the liberal arts, and it\\'s not hard to see how the iPad\\'s roots as ostensibly a bigger iPhone can be an asset rather than a liability. You just have to be willing to keep an open mind.\\n\\n\"In many ways, education and accessibility beautifully overlap,\" Sarah Herrlinger, Apple\\'s Director of Global Accessibility Policy & Initiatives, told me in a 2018 interview for TechCrunch. \"For us, the concept of differentiated learning and how the accessibility tools that we build in [products] help make that [learning] possible is really important to us.\"\\n\\nIn order to completely understand why iPad has been so successful for students, parents, and educators, it\\'s crucial to first examine the iPad at the product\\'s most basic level. This means the object itself and its interaction model.\\n\\nIn written retrospectives and on podcasts, many in the Apple commentariat have pointed to the chair Jobs sat in as he demonstrated the original iPad on January 27, 2010 as a metaphor for Apple\\'s goal with the device. The chair helped telegraph what the iPad meant to Apple; to wit, that the product\\'s form factor (and accompanying software) represented the company\\'s conception for the future of personal computing. That Jobs was casually sitting back in that cushy recliner, browsing photos, writing email, and reading the (Flash-free) New York Times, sent the message that the iPad was highly unlike any conventional computer. To paraphrase Jony Ive, the iPad\\'s physical nature meant it conformed to the user rather than forcing the user to conform to it - which it continues to do with aplomb to this day. It was primarily for this reason Jobs described the product as \"magical and revolutionary.\"\\n\\nIn terms of accessibility, the idea that the iPad is nothing but a slab of metal and glass is the main attraction. For users with certain cognitive delays, for example, the iPad is a near perfect device. To use it is to literally put your hands on the screen. iPadOS is far less conceptually complex than macOS; there are no required pointing devices or windows to fiddle with. Likewise, visually impaired users can hold the tablet as close to their face as necessary to see. In both scenarios, this flexibility is made possible because Apple rethought the computing experience down to its essence. And that\\'s saying nothing about the deeply-integrated system accessibility features designed to aid and enhance the user experience for everyone, regardless of ability.\\n\\nWhat this ultimately means is that the advent of the iPad ushered in a new era, an era in which the device is tailor-made to enable learning through technology. Particularly for those in special education settings, the iPad was (and remains) very much the Platonic ideal in terms of modern, accessible, and engaging teaching tools. And it\\'s because one of the iPad\\'s greatest strengths is that it\\'s essentially a big iPhone.\\n\\nBefore getting into tech journalism in May 2013, I spent more than a decade as a paraeducator (the more professional name for a teacher\\'s aide) working in middle school and preschool special education classrooms. The last nine years of my career were spent with children aged 3 to 5, where we used technology like the iPad (and iPod touch) in small-group activities. Having spent most of my time with students on the autism spectrum, I was trained in several teaching methodologies designed for autistic children. I found the iPad to be great in not only gauging expressive and receptive language skills, it also was great in introducing and reinforcing pre-academic concepts such as identifying colors, letters, and shapes. In fact, my first-ever bylined piece, titled \"Re-Enabled,\" centered around how iOS and the iPad made life more accessible for my students, as well as myself.\\n\\nDuring my teaching years, I also studied early childhood development part-time at my then-local community college. The combination of real world, hands-on experience of my job and the textbook theoretical learning in my schooling helped me synthesize the disparate experiences I had at work and as a student. This proved especially beneficial as I was learning how children typically develop from infancy through early elementary age while at the same time working daily in a decidedly atypical environment, developmentally speaking. I was very much \"between worlds,\" so to speak.\\n\\nWhat I wrote seven years ago in The Magazine remains true today. While there is no substitute for analog, real-life, play-based learning experiences for young children, there can be no denying the realities of the modern world. The iPad as a teaching tool not only bridges the analog and digital worlds, it allows for more immersive and innovative opportunities for students than ever before. For early childhood special education, where learning and teaching oftentimes take new meaning, the iPad can be utterly transformative. Not only for the child, but for the adult too.\\n\\nI cannot emphasize enough how astonishing it was to watch my students, some of whom had fairly severe cognitive delays, take to the iPad so naturally and with such immediacy. Launching apps, swiping through pages, even the advanced multitasking gestures were all, pun intended, child\\'s play. This speaks volumes of not only the allure of things that light up and make noise, but of the genius of Apple building the iPad\\'s UI on top of the iPhone\\'s operating system. Like the decision to base iOS on many of OS X\\'s underpinnings, the choice to base the iPad on iOS was immensely prudent by Apple. We reap the benefits of it every day.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that if technology like the iPad is embraced and used with purpose, then it absolutely can augment the traditional materials and teaching methodologies that have been around schools forever. In my time in classrooms, I\\'ve seen firsthand how old and new can go meaningfully together.\\n\\nIt\\'s no secret Apple believes strongly in the iPad. Although the iPad\\'s software story has looked weak until recently, the hardware has never been better - arguably the company\\'s best, maybe ever. The current iPad Pro design language is breathtakingly beautiful, so much so that many in the Apple community (myself included) hope Apple carries it over to the iPhone as soon as possible. Accessory-wise, the Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil are first-class peripherals. The second-generation Pencil is, in my estimation, every bit as delightful and magical as AirPods. Like the earbuds, it\\'s not apparent in using the Pencil that it\\'s effectively a teeny-tiny computer with sensors and other tech inside. Using it is uncannily like using a regular pencil, albeit one that never smears or needs sharpening.\\n\\nApple has gone on the record about how iPads can be used in classrooms, most notably with its Everyone Can Code initiative and Swift Playgrounds on iOS and the Mac. Herrlinger has said to me many times over the years that when Apple says everyone can code, they really do mean everyone; staying true to their ethos, Apple built Everyone Can Code with accessibility top of mind. Swift Playgrounds is fully accessible to disabled users, offering robust integration with features like VoiceOver and Switch Control. There\\'s even downloadable tactile puzzles in Braille and coding videos presented in American Sign Language for aspiring blind and visually impaired and hard-of-hearing/deaf coders, respectively.\\n\\n\"We believe in focusing on ability rather than disability. We believe coding is a language - a language that should be accessible to everyone,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said to me at an Everyone Can Code kickoff event in 2018.\\n\\nApple\\'s approach to the iPad in the classroom is broad in scope; they don\\'t focus on providing esoteric, specialized tools for teachers and other professionals in special education. The company instead leverages its massive App Store ecosystem by allowing third-party developers to create apps for learning and communication. That said, the Apple-designed Classroom and Schoolwork apps can hold relevance to accessibility. This marches in lockstep with Apple\\'s overarching philosophy surrounding the iPad. The act of individualizing what one needs or wants from the device gets to the core of what has made the iPad so unique to so many.\\n\\nMeg Wilson, a former special education teacher who now works at Apple, told me in a 2018 interview that Schoolwork in particular presents \"an amazing opportunity for collaboration amongst service providers\" when it comes to continually updating colleagues on students\\' progress throughout the school year; this perpetual stream of updates also opens the door to faster adjustment of a student\\'s goals and objectives. Likewise, Wilson told me a teacher or other support staff could add their entire caseload into Schoolwork and have progress reports at the ready anytime, anywhere. And for Classroom, educators can \"lock\" a group of students (or just one) into an app so that she or he stays on task and completes their activity. For students who don\\'t need much scaffolding or prompting, it\\'s easy to share work with their teacher(s) with a couple taps using the system share sheet.\\n\\n\"When you are creative with technology, you change people\\'s lives,\" Wilson said.\\n\\nBeing creative with technology is what the iPad was made for. As Apple sees it, the impact the device has on education is a microcosm of what makes the iPad so special. Students and teachers alike can turn the iPad into whatever they need it to be in order to enhance the classroom experience. Tim Cook often opens events with his boilerplate statement about how Apple\\'s North Star is building products that enrich and empower lives, and it isn\\'t an empty bromide. The iPad does precisely that for special education professionals on a daily basis. To say the iPad has been a revolution in special education settings isn\\'t an exaggeration - it\\'s exactly right.\\n\\n\"Education and accessibility are inextricably tied in many ways,\" Herrlinger said in a recent interview. \"What the iPad has done for classrooms to empower and enrich the lives of students is what we strive for when making these products.\"\\n\\nOne of the most prominent places where the iPad excels as a teaching tool is in speech therapy sessions. Speech and language therapy plays an integral role in special education settings, as SLPs (speech and language pathologists) support the work happening in the classroom. These specialists extend the experience by tirelessly working to facilitate language and pro-social behavior between children and staff, but most importantly, between their peers and parents. This work goes a long way in providing enriching, developmentally appropriate programs.\\n\\nKirsty Maksel, a speech therapist based in the Bay Area who works at an elementary school, has used iPads with her students over the past 4-5 years. A self-professed \"late adopter,\" her iPad is an older model, one with the 30-pin iPod connector of yore. For students who have limited verbal skills, or who are totally non-verbal, Maksel says the iPad \"has made voice output communication software much more accessible than a $15,000 to $20,000 dollar dedicated device.\" She said her iPad is used in both group (\"push-in\") and individual (\"pull-out\") sessions.\\n\\nFor Maksel, the iPad is used to encourage communication. She mainly uses voice-output communication apps, telling me Proloquo2go and Go Talk are mainstays for her. \"They [her students] are learning to request, comment, and command. Some are learning to ask structured questions. I [also] model core vocabulary as they are learning new vocabulary words,\" she said. Maksel added she uses YouTube to play songs that connect thematically to books she uses, noting that she expects students to sing along and mimic motor movements as songs go on.\\n\\nIn this environment, the iPad is not a toy - it\\'s a teaching tool. Thus, Maksel has tried to curtail some of the device\\'s irresistibility by removing irrelevant apps from the device, as well as putting it in a case. An external speaker, she said, also helps in this regard because it\\'s needed for better sound. A byproduct of this is that it also directs the sound away from the device itself, which can help with attention.\\n\\nLike Maksel, Courtney Caviggia is a Bay Area speech therapist who utilizes the iPad. Working with preschoolers, Caviggia has spent the last eight years using \"a few different generations\" of the iPad mini. For her purposes, like Maksel, Caviggia uses the iPad as a means to promote communication during sessions with her students. Apps are obviously the centerpiece of the tablet experience, and Caviggia has many favorites, including the aforementioned Proloquo2go, Go Talk, and YouTube.\\n\\n\"I love interactive apps, music and dance apps for children, children\\'s apps, learning apps, and ones that give positive reinforcement for correct answers provided. I enjoy apps with visual supports for students,\" she said. \"I have also used several AAC apps and systems that are used on the iPad and they have been extremely easy to use and adapt to student needs.\"\\n\\nCaviggia told me she\\'s been using the iPad for so long that she\\'s \"found it to be an asset in therapy.\" It does everything from model turn-taking to being a discrete communication device to being a motivator and reward for hard work and good behavior. But the assets lie not only with her students; they benefit her just as much. Take data-tracking, for instance. Data collection is critically important to special educators, who rely on the information when writing progress reports and participating in annual IEP meetings. What Meg Wilson said is a truism for special educators that\\'s practically as essential to life as food and water: \"What we need in special ed is data - we need data.\" In Caviggia\\'s case, she said she likes how many apps she uses include score-taking, which allows her to focus all her energy on the student rather than interrupt the flow to jot something down for later.\\n\\nFor all the iPad\\'s strengths, Caviggia has a few gripes. The iPad\\'s appeal is a double-edged sword, because the device can be as distracting as it is motivating. \"Some students have a hard time taking turns with such a highly motivating object,\" she said. Caviggia further lamented how \"frustrating\" it can be that the iPad has a finite lifespan in terms of software updates. As the iPad ages, access to app updates, new apps, and new OS features can be limited if a hardware upgrade isn\\'t feasible.\\n\\nDillan Barmache is a non-verbal autistic man and self-described \"advocate for autistic voices.\" Apple told his story in April 2016 as part of recognizing Autism Acceptance Month. Then 16, he explained in a poignant, now-private video called \"Dillan\\'s Voice\" how the iPad \"changed everything in my life\" because the device allowed him to finally have a voice with which he could communicate with people.\\n\\n\"All my life I wanted so badly to connect with people,\" Barmache said in the video. \"Without a voice, people only see my autism and not the real me.\"\\n\\nBarmache\\'s mother, Tami, was awestruck at her son\\'s voice. She stated in the video: \"As his mom, it\\'s just the most incredible thing ever to suddenly start to hear your child\\'s voice,\" she said. \"Not being able to speak is not the same as not having something to say.\"\\n\\nIn an interview with Mashable that coincided with the premiere of his film, Dillan went into greater detail about what it feels like to be autistic, how the iPad empowered him, and how amplifying his voice affected those around him. He put it succinctly in one sentence, saying: \"The iPad allows me to be seen.\"\\n\\nIn my interviews with Maksel and Caviggia, both mentioned one of their most heavily-used apps is AssistiveWare\\'s communication board app, Proloquo2go. This is noteworthy because not only is the app professional (and, at $250, professionally priced) but because the coming of the iPad made it possible for the app to exist.\\n\\nThe Amsterdam-based AssistiveWare has been a presence on the iOS App Store since the beginning; work on Proloquo2go began in May 2008, with the first version shipping nearly a year later in April 2009. Company founder and CEO David Niemeijer said to me via email that Proloquo2go was optimized for Apple\\'s tablet right from the get-go, and has been in the store \"from day one.\" To date, the app has been downloaded over 250,000 times worldwide. The advent of the App Store and the iPad not only helped hundreds of thousands of users over the past decade, but it helped AssistiveWare too. What started as a one-man operation, Niemeijer said, has grown to a team of over 30 members who were paid a visit by Tim Cook.\\n\\nProloquo2go was \"propelled into a whole other league\" upon the iPad\\'s introduction, Niemeijer told me. \"It was immediately clear to me that this would be the perfect device [for the app],\" he said. It was previously available on the smaller iPhone and iPod touch. Furthermore, he and his team saw \"two key benefits\" of the tablet\\'s large screen. \"Firstly, it allowed us to offer more words on the screen at once,\" he said. \"Secondly, many people with speech challenges also have fine-motor or visual challenges, making the larger screen much easier to work with.\"\\n\\nNiemeijer wrote in 2018 about Proloquo2go\\'s origin story, as well as about how the App Store\\'s opening in 2008 and the iPad\\'s debut two years later kickstarted what he called the \"democratization of communication.\" Like Maksel, he observed how the iPad was a game-changer for families and professionals. At $500, iPad was eminently more affordable and readily available than dedicated AAC devices, most of which are exorbitantly priced and only available on the whims of a slow approval process. \"Professionals were no longer, through a formal assessment process, the gatekeepers to communication devices,\" Niemeijer wrote on Medium. \"Parents and individuals with communication challenges could now make their own decisions.\"\\n\\nRegarding the iPad in general, Niemeijer thinks it\\'s \"an amazing device that is only getting better and better.\" He said he\\'s happy the entry-level model continues to become more affordable, and is \"super happy\" the iPad mini is still around for younger children. As for the Pro models, Niemeijer told me their considerably better sound make using communication apps like his better, and wishes the speakers in the less expensive iPads had better audio fidelity. He\\'s also impressed by iOS and iPadOS 13\\'s addition of pointer support, saying the newfound compatibility with joysticks, trackballs, and mice have further expanded access to the tablet.\\n\\nMark Coppin is Director of Disability Services at North Dakota State University. An assistive technology professional for over three decades, Coppin\\'s responsibilities at the school focus on supporting people with disabilities by providing suitable accommodations. Prior to the iPad, he used the iPod touch with students, but said he realized the tablet would \"profoundly change special education and education in general.\" He currently uses both an 11-inch and a 12.9-inch iPad Pro; he uses both sizes so he can \"evaluate the best size and fit for those I work with,\" Coppin said.\\n\\nYet it was the iPod that sold him on technology\\'s capacity for facilitating learning.\\n\\n\"It was a device that my students gravitated to,\" he said. \"I was working a lot with students on the autism spectrum at the time, and the device seemed to make sense for many of them. It was visual and they were able to control the device by interacting directly with the screen. It was also very engaging and new content was being developed everyday.\"\\n\\nThe iPad\\'s arrival was a watershed moment of sorts for Coppin, as it exponentially built upon what was on the iPod touch in a literally bigger way. \"I saw this huge screen, a portable device, and an affordable device priced at a consumer level. I knew it would be a powerful solution for my students and clients,\" he said. \"This device replaced many expensive assistive technology solutions; it could be personalized and customized to meet the needs of my students and clients.\"\\n\\nHe continued: \"I have seen a huge shift in our field because of the iPad,\" he said. \"Tools and solutions that were once considered assistive technology or specialized solutions are now a part of the OS. That means they are available to everyone - they are free and powerful solutions that level the playing field.\"\\n\\nAs for the iPad at his workplace, Coppin told me students at the university love the iPad for how engaging it is and how it invites them to explore their creativity. He told me \"the beautiful thing\" about the iPad is that every modification is transparent to anyone. Moreover, Coppin appreciates how the iPad\\'s flexibility allows him to individualize the device such that it caters to a student\\'s needs and desires, as well as being a great adherent to Universal Design for Learning best practices. He also noted how NDSU professors have embraced the iPad, saying the device allows for myriad ways of learning, networking, and staying engaged with the curriculum.\\n\\n\"It gives me the opportunity to optimize their [students\\'] learning,\" he said. \"For a student who struggles with fine-motor control, I can make accommodations to compensate for their fine-motor limitations. For a student who cannot see, I can show them VoiceOver. For a struggling reader or non-reader, I can show them features where they can have the text read to them. For a student who cannot touch the screen, I can turn on Switch Control and give them independent access to the device.\" Coppin said his personal favorite iPad features all involve accessibility, but his most favorite is Switch Control. He loves how it levels the field by allowing someone to play a game such as Angry Birds like anyone else. He said he knew several students with cerebral palsy who were \"desperate\" to try Switch Control on the iPad after struggling to use the device\\'s touchscreen. \"If they could play Angry Birds, they could do practically anything everyone else could,\" he said.\\n\\nCoppin was effusive overall in his praise of the iPad. He\\'s an ardent supporter of not only iPadOS as a platform, but also of how technology can unleash new ways of learning and connecting for students and teachers. \"I love it when new accessibility features come out because, when I explore these features, I have a particular person in mind,\" he said. \"I know that that one feature can make a profound difference in that person\\'s life. One small feature can make so much difference.\"\\n\\nOn the flip side, Coppin has no nits to pick with the iPad itself. What bothers him is how some educators perceive the iPad and how it\\'s utilized in some classrooms.\\n\\n\"There needs to be some intentionality in its use. But some educators take it too far and they think that the iPad will solve everything,\" he said. \"They think that if you give a student an iPad, they will automatically learn. In the end, you still have to teach and be pedagogically sound. The iPad is just another educational tool but it can be a powerful tool in the hands of a good teacher.\"\\n\\nCoincidentally, Coppin revealed his friendship with AssistiveWare\\'s Niemeijer. Coppin is yet another Proloquo2go devotee, telling me that he knew \"it would completely revolutionize the industry\" the first time he used the application.\\n\\nAs I wrote earlier, there were a slew of think pieces from various voices in the Apple community published in January as the iPad\\'s tenth birthday approached. One of those pieces was written by Stratechery\\'s Ben Thompson, who posited the tablet as a tragic figure because, while phenomenal in myriad ways yet so hindered in others, it never has quite lived up to the stratospheric hype surrounding it over the past decade. He wrote, in part: \"the tragedy of the iPad is not that it flopped; it is that it never did, and likely never will, reach that potential so clearly seen ten years ago.\"\\n\\nHowever niche relative to the iPad\\'s overall standing, one could make a legitimate case that, in an accessibility context, the device has more than lived up to its potential. Consider the testimonies from people like Maksel and Niemeijer on using iPads as communication boards. This is a non-trivial, literally life-altering use case. Using the iPad for \"real work\" is not solely the domain of power users, the iPad aficionados who routinely push iPadOS to the limits by using complex shortcuts and by editing podcasts with Apple Pencil. There\\'s a tendency in the tech community at large to associate \"real work\" with producing in creative mediums like photography, music, art, and coding. Apple is guilty of falling into this trap, given their proclivity for showcasing such work in ads and at events. While there\\'s nothing inherently wrong with this approach, what is missed is the idea that \"real work\" needn\\'t be cerebral or showy to be meaningful. Real work is also about using iPads in speech therapy sessions and to teach foundational skills like colors. It\\'s not as flashy and nerdy, and doesn\\'t make many headlines, but is nonetheless serious in its own right.\\n\\nConsider also the iPad\\'s form factor. Much of the consternation from certain factions of the Apple community surrounding the iPad, particularly since the iPad Pro debuted in 2015, has stemmed from whether it can (or should) replace Mac laptops. It already has for many people, due to the versatile nature of the device and the software enhancements that have come over the last few iOS releases. But there\\'s another reason to prefer an iPad over a MacBook: as ever, it\\'s accessibility.\\n\\nI\\'ve literally called the iPad \"the most accessible computer Apple has ever built.\" High praise, but the declaration is justified in two key ways. First, iOS is simpler and more streamlined than macOS. For someone with certain cognitive impairments, for instance, the default one-app-at-a-time windowing model does a lot to reduce cognitive load and increase concentration. Secondly, someone who\\'s visually impaired shouldn\\'t have to chase the mouse pointer around the screen, nor be as precise with clicking smaller menu bar items and other UI buttons. Most importantly, because an iPad\\'s screen is more flexible than a laptop\\'s, people like me don\\'t necessarily have to press their noses against the glass in order to see well.\\n\\nNiemeijer echoed my thoughts over the advantages of the iPad\\'s form factor.\\n\\n\"Thanks to the wide range of accessibility features Apple built into iOS, they have achieved a true universal design. iPads are truly for everyone and people with disabilities can use an iPad for much the same things as everyone else,\" he said. \"If you think about it, an all-glass user interface is not the first thing you think of when providing access to someone who cannot see the screen or cannot touch it - yet if you cannot see or cannot use your hands, you can still use an iPad thanks to all the built-in accessibility features.\"\\n\\nAs are all Apple products, Macs are fully accessible and have been for several years. Nevertheless, the ergonomic differences between iPads and MacBooks are very real; that an iPad can be much better is again a testament to Apple hitting the bullseye when it conjured up the original product\\'s hardware design. Put another way, pitting one versus the other isn\\'t always about lazy tropes about real work or software preferences and limitations. Sometimes, as is the case here, one can be clearly better due to a multitude of factors that include accessibility. It doesn\\'t mean either is categorically worse or we dislike what we don\\'t use. It means, for many, \"better\" is judged by more than an arbitrary getting-things-done metric.\\n\\nAlthough Thompson makes a compelling argument that the iPad has missed its potential, it\\'s equally as compelling to counter his assertion by highlighting accessibility\\'s role. In this sense, the iPad has clearly been triumphant. As a tool for assistive technology, it has reached self-actualization and then some.\\n\\nTo appreciate the breakthroughs the iPad has afforded in areas like special education and communication, one must take a holistic view of history. The iPad is not perfect; it can (and will) always improve. As time marches on, so too will technology. For accessibility, however, it comes closest to perfection, to fully realizing Apple\\'s ambitions with the device. This is not insignificant and cannot be overstated; accessibility has been just as instrumental in shaping the iPad\\'s journey as the much-ballyhooed Mac-like productivity capabilities. This aspect of the tablet\\'s story is an angle equally deserving of such recognition.\\n\\nThe iPad has been so prosperous for accessibility, and for the mainstream user too, because of the fact that it\\'s \"just a big iPhone.\" This former mockery is myopic; it\\'s unwarranted and mistakenly conflates elaboration with progress. It\\'s an interesting dichotomy - Apple clearly has evolved the device, as they should, but I think it\\'s easy to get caught up in all the hustle and bustle. People don\\'t stop and smell the roses, so to speak, and appreciate the simpler part of life. Although watching iPadOS mature with wonderful tools is great in the grand scheme, I think people sometimes forget about the iPad\\'s soul, the elemental parts of it that make it so beloved. This hearkens back to the founding design: it was like the iPhone. There\\'s something to be said for its simplicity enduring amidst the incessant want for more.\\n\\nTo me, the iPad is neither an abject failure nor a victim of some tragedy. The iPad has had a fruitful life, period. Judging whether something is good or bad, technologically speaking, can be subjective. This is especially true for accessibility. Being a big iPhone can indeed be a good thing; it just depends on who\\'s using it. A grid of icons and a single app paradigm are more befitting across a variety of accessibility-oriented situations. This needs to be celebrated more often.\\n\\nGiven how complex the makeover has been, that the iPad\\'s defining characteristic - where the app is the screen and the screen is the app - persists so prominently is no small feat. The iPad\\'s essential simplicity remains endearing to legions of accessibility-minded people, folks like Caviggia and Coppin. Illustrating how the iPad works well as \"just a big iPhone\" is profound; it shines a powerful perspective on a notion that has plagued the iPad since its earliest days with Jobs in that chair.\\n\\nThere\\'s an adage popular with those in special education circles, which is that people who work in special education are special. That\\'s undoubtedly true. I can\\'t help but think there\\'s a charming synergy between the people who work in the field and technological marvels like the iPad which empowers them to change the lives of children and their families. As Herrlinger and Wilson have said to me on multiple occasions, that\\'s Apple\\'s entire modus operandi in a nutshell.\\n\\nIf this story were one of Aesop\\'s Fables, the moral probably would be that the iPad\\'s barometer for success does not solely hinge on loads of multi-modal, multi-windowed, whiz-bang productivity features. That they\\'re optional is immaterial to the broader point here because, in the end, they tell only one part of the story. The contributions the iPad has made to further accessibility matter too, which is why it\\'s important to point out that being just a big iPhone is okay, enlightening even.',\n",

       "    'title': 'It is best to Buy Apple Watch Series 4 and Skip the Apple Watch Series 5 In 2020.',\n",
       "    'body': \"(ThyBlackMan.com) The Apple Watch Series 4 is the fastest smartwatch available in the market. It packs health features such as improved heart sensors, ECG, and fall detection. The smartwatch also sports a bigger display that offers more screen space while retaining the rectangular shape of the Apple Watch.\\n\\nThis year Apple will release the Watch Series 5. Based on Apple's track record, there will be plenty of new features making you want to rush to your nearest Apple store. But there are also reasons why it is best to buy Apple Watch Series 4 in 2019. As we get closer to the release date of Watch Series 5, we are seeing more and more reasons why skipping the upcoming smartwatch would be a better idea.\\n\\nBefore we get into the Apple Watch Series 5 leaks and rumored features, it's worth pointing out that the Watch Series 4 is still the most preferred choice of smartwatch fans around the world. It should be noted that there was a time when Apple was struggling to figure out what it wanted from the Apple Watch. The smartwatch, in a true sense, is a value for money wearable that now stands on its own feet.\\n\\nThe Watch Series 4 made that big leap everyone was waiting for. Despite having a slightly different design, it supports all the old watch bands, performs faster than its predecessors, has 16GB of storage which is sufficient for watch owners, and also brings some cool features like Walkie-Talkie and even more advanced fitness tracking capabilities. Apple has perfectly put a bigger screen into a small rectangular design by shrinking the bezels and pushing the screen to the edge. The result is impressive - more screen area and pixels on the 40mm and 44mm watch models.\\n\\nApple made some major design changes in the Watch Series 4. The smartwatch not only has become less bulky, but it also sports a beautiful ceramic and sapphire crystal-made heart rate sensor which is more accurate and improves signal reception. Apple also worked on the watch's speaker and made it 50 percent louder. The digital crown that sits on the side has been designed to improve haptic feedback and it feels smooth to use.\\n\\nThe Apple Watch Series 4 took a big step forward in terms of processing power. Apple jumped from 32-bit chips to 64-bit dual-core S4 chip. Coupled with 16GB of storage, this hardware upgrade made a huge difference in performance making the Watch Series 4 one of the fastest smartwatches available. According to Apple, this new chip performs 50 percent faster than the S3 chip.\\n\\nWith all these powerful features and hardware power, the Apple Watch Series 4 has become something more than a fitness tracker. Interestingly, using the Apple Watch doesn't feel like a chore anymore. So, what should we expect from its successor, the Apple Watch Series 5? Obviously, the next Apple Watch will have some cool new features, some improvements in design and hardware, and it will arrive with a new version of the WatchOS. Apple hasn't confirmed anything about the Watch Series 5, but leaked details suggest that this year's update will be boring and dull.\\n\\nThe new Apple Watch is said to retain the design, size, and shape of the Watch Series 4, so if you're expecting a round-shaped Apple Watch, this isn't going to happen this year. It makes sense because Apple wouldn't want to run its watches on two different layouts of WatchOS 6. The new watch will sport a new S5 chip with some performance improvements and it will likely become completely independent from the iPhone. Apple has recently increased the storage capacity of its watches, so it's unlikely that the company will increase the storage in this generation of Apple Watch.\\n\\nThe Apple Watch Series 4 will smoothly run the next one or two versions of the WatchOS, so it's safe to assume that the watch will continue to receive software updates in the future. It should be noted that the WatchOS 5 still supports all the Apple Watch Series models except the first-generation Apple Watch. In terms of features, it is sure that Apple will bring some of the health and fitness-based features which are missing in the Watch Series 4.\\n\\nNew Apple Watch Series 5 features may include dedicated iOS apps for period tracking, sleep tracking, and glucose monitoring. The period tracking feature is an interesting idea but there are many third-party apps available on App Store and they serve the purpose. Apple is reportedly working on a sleep tracker for the Apple Watch, but according to people familiar with the project, this feature is reserved for the Apple Watch 6 which is expected to arrive in 2020.\\n\\nThere are also rumors about a standalone Siri Watch Face and a blood pressure monitoring sensor for the Apple Watch Series 5, but these features will most likely arrive in the Watch Series 6. Even if Apple adds such features to the Watch Series 5, it would not get FDA clearance for the same. We have heard that Apple is working with many health experts around the world. The company has also published many reports and findings from its research, but there's no concrete evidence to support the claims about any groundbreaking feature in the Watch Series 5.\\n\\nIn the last two years, Apple has drastically increased the price of its products. The Apple Watch Series 4 starts at $399, however, you may now buy the watch at a much lower price. It is likely that the Watch Series 5 will also be available in the same $399 price range, but depending on your region, the prices may vary because of the US-China trade war and Brexit. If you're determined to get value for money and prefer a future-proof smartwatch, it's best to buy Apple Watch Series 4.\",\n",

       "    'title': 'Back to the Mac 017: Mac hardware is healthy again [Video] - 9to5Mac',\n",
       "    'body': \"It wasn't that long ago when I had to ask myself the unthinkable question: Is it time to start looking seriously at Windows machines? Indeed, the state of Mac hardware was that bleak just a few years ago. What a difference a few years makes.\\n\\nThankfully I never had to follow through with such an unfortunate decision. That's because the state of Mac hardware, just a few years later, is at its healthiest level in years. How did we get there? Watch our latest episode of Back to the Mac for the details.\\n\\nStarted from the top\\n\\nFor as much grief as people gave Apple's executive team about the poor direction of Mac hardware, it would be wrong to not also give credit to the team who orchestrated the turnaround.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, Apple had to admit it was wrong, which is never an easy thing for a proud company to do. These hardware changes just didn't sprout out of thin air, but they're the result of leadership recognizing their mistakes and taking action.\\n\\nThis line of thinking was well illustrated in April 2017, when, in an unprecedented move for the company at the time, it invited journalists to a roundtable to discuss the future of Mac hardware.\\n\\nAlso discussed were some of the mistakes that Apple had made, plans to address the issues, and it even went as far as to pre-announce hardware. Again, this was unheard of at the time.\\n\\nTo be clear, Apple still has a ways to go, but the company has taken big steps toward improving its perception among Mac faithful.\\n\\nBack to the Mac 017: Mac hardware is healthy again!\\n\\nSpecial thanks to Hyper for sponsoring 9to5mac on YouTube: The HyperDrive Gen 2 USB-C Hub is available in 6-, 12-, and 18-port varieties.\\n\\nSubscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more videos\\n\\neGPUs\\n\\nBefore any new hardware was released, the eGPU was the first tangible indication that Apple was trying to put the Mac back on the proper course. Initially, external graphics chassises needed workarounds to gain support in macOS, but eventually native support for eGPUs began to roll out.\\n\\nOver time, Apple has lended more support for external graphics in macOS, and even has a support page where it outlines which eGPUs are recommended for macOS. Eventually, Apple began carrying two eGPUs in its stores, the Blackmagic eGPU and the Blackmagic eGPU Pro.\\n\\nExternal graphics support continues to grow in macOS. You can now force applications to prefer external graphics, and apps like Final Cut Pro X feature preferences that allow you to specify which GPU will be used for rendering and export.\\n\\niMac Pro\\n\\neGPUs are nice, but it was the the iMac Pro that solidified Apple's desire to get back into the good graces of Mac users. The iMac Pro, though released at the end of 2017, remains one of the best Macs that Apple sells today, and is one of the best Mac machines that Apple has released in the last decade.\\n\\nApple took the exact form factor of its popular all-in-one iMac, and upgraded the internals with Intel Xeon CPUs, Radeon Vega graphics, ECC RAM, and lots of fast solid-state storage.\\n\\nBut my favorite thing about the iMac Pro is just how incredibly quiet it is. Thanks to a completely redesigned internal cooling system, it's much quieter than the regular 5K iMac.\\n\\n2018 MacBook Pro\\n\\nThe MacBook Pro is Apple's most popular desktop computer, so imagine how happy Apple fans were to finally have a laptop with a serious hardware upgrade. While the 2018 MacBook Pro didn't address the terrible butterfly keyboard switch issues -- that would come a year later in 2019 -- it did provide a much-needed processing and graphics boost. The 2018 MacBook Pro also made it possible to configure more than 16GB of RAM in a MacBook Pro for the first time.\\n\\nFaster MacBook Pro releases\\n\\nAfter the release of the 2018 MacBook Pro, Apple pushed spec bumps, like the 2019 refresh that brought an 8-core CPU to the MacBook Pro for the very first time.\\n\\n2018 Mac mini\\n\\nIt seemed almost like a dream when it was released, but after four years of waiting, we finally got a refreshed Mac mini near the end of 2018. The 2018 Mac mini, while retaining the same form factor as its predecessor, came with a new space gray exterior, and featured significantly upgraded internals. In fact, at the time of its release, I called it the most versatile Mac that Apple sold. That title has since been claimed by the Mac Pro, but the Mac mini is a much more affordable machine for the general consumer.\\n\\nWhat I love about the new Mac mini, besides its 10GbE and 6-Core i7 CPU build to order options, is its inclusion of four Thunderbolt 3 ports. Like the iMac Pro, the four Thunderbolt three ports on the Mac mini give it amazing versatility and the ability to work with a plethora of external Thunderbolt 3 devices. For the money, it's probably the best bang for the buck in the whole Mac lineup.\\n\\n2018 MacBook Air\\n\\nLike the Mac mini, the MacBook Air was on hiatus for several years, and like the Mac mini, it returned to action in late 2018. Its biggest feature, the addition of a Retina display for the very first time, brought a much-needed upgrade to the popular laptop line.\\n\\nAnother first for the MacBook Air was its adoption of Thunderbolt 3. The Air scored not just one but two Thunderbolt 3 ports, adding plenty of external upgrade potential to Apple's most affordable laptop.\\n\\nWith only one available processor -- a power-sipping 7W 1.6GHz dual-core 8th-generation Intel Core i5 -- the MacBook Air isn't the laptop meant for powering through massive video editing projects, 3D modeling, and the like. However, it's probably the best Apple laptop for most casual users in need of a machine to handle basic tasks like word processing, web browsing, etc.\\n\\nAnd thanks to its external expandability via Thunderbolt 3, it can handle even more intense workloads when paired with an eGPU.\\n\\n2019 iMac\\n\\nLast March Apple finally updated both its 21.5-inch 4K iMac and 27-inch 5K iMac with new CPUs, including new quad-core, 6-core, and 8-core options. Higher end iMacs also gained access to faster Radeon Pro Vega Graphics.\\n\\nAs I noted in my five takeaways from an iMac Pro user post, the 8-core 5K iMac featured impressive iMac Pro-like CPU performance. For half the price of a $5,000 base model iMac Pro, you get CPU performance that goes toe-to-toe and even beats the iMac Pro in some areas.\\n\\nThe 27-inch iMac can also accommodate up to 128GB of RAM, which can be upgraded by the users via a convenient access port on the rear of the machine. We published a tutorial shortly after the release of the updated 5K iMac with instructions showing how to upgrade to 128GB of RAM.\\n\\nSadly, Apple gimps the base 2019 iMac with a Fusion Drive, which can negatively affect performance. If you're considering an iMac, avoid the Fusion Drive if at all possible. Apple also continues to sell a non-Retina iMac, the only device in its entire lineup without a Retina display.\\n\\n2019 MacBook Pro spec bump\\n\\nIn mid-2019, Apple released a spec bump update to the MacBook Pro headlined by an 9th-generation 8-Core Intel i9 CPU in the 15-inch model, the first time we saw an 8-core CPU in an Apple laptop. This update addressed one of the primary complaints with the 2018 MacBook Pro, that of heavy throttling with the CPU.\\n\\n2019 entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro\\n\\nLater in 2019, Apple released a brand-new, entry-level MacBook Pro, replacing the model that had lingered in the lineup since 2017. Although on paper, the new entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro seems anemic from a performance perspective, the 1.4GHz Quad-Core CPU powering the machine is actually quite capable.\\n\\nThe great thing about the new base MacBook Pro is that it starts at the same $1,299 price as its predecessor, but comes with a quad-core CPU this time, and features the Touch Bar alongside a very handy Touch ID fingerprint sensor.\\n\\nAlthough the 2018 MacBook Air, which starts off $200 less than the MacBook Pro, is more affordable, it might be worth considering the upgrade for the added CPU capability.\\n\\n16-inch MacBook Pro\\n\\nApple's first 16-inch edition of the MacBook Pro finally provided a long-awaited fix to the failed butterfly key switches, outright replacing the key switches with a more traditional scissor switch mechanism.\\n\\nBesides the keyboard fix, the 16-inch MacBook Pro featured a slightly larger display with higher resolution, an option to configure up to 64GB of RAM and 8TB of storage -- both firsts for an Apple laptop, wide stereo six-speaker sound, and more.\\n\\nAlthough Apple still has a long way to go in order to fix the keyboard issue that plagues all of its other laptops, I see the release of the 16-inch MacBook Pro as the symbolic end of Apple's disastrous period for Mac hardware that began in 2016.\\n\\nMac Pro\\n\\nIf the 16-inch MacBook Pro capped off the end of a once disappointing Mac era, the 2019 Mac Pro lays out new beginnings and an exciting future for the Mac. After all, this is the machine that was talked about during that first meeting where Apple publicly acknowledged that it had made some poor decisions regarding the direction of the Mac.\\n\\nThe Mac Pro is everything and more that it was hyped up to be. As I noted in our hands-on, first-look video, this isn't the Mac for most people, and its cost, especially when upgraded during the build-to-order process, can be quite prohibitive.\\n\\nBut if you can put a machine like the Mac Pro to good use, you'll find an insane amount of power and capability on tap. The CPU, for instance, can be configured up to a 24-core monster, while users with especially deep pockets can add a pair of Radeon Pro Vega II Duo MPX Modules, which individually Apple touts as being the world's most powerful graphics card.\\n\\nMy favorite thing about the Mac Pro, however, is the sheer amount of upgradeability. As a Mac user in the Thunderbolt 3 era, I'm used to being able to take advantage of all sorts of interesting external upgrades, but this is the first time that we've had a machine that can do both external and internal upgrades on a wide scale.\\n\\nThanks to PCIe access, users can add graphics cards, super-fast PCIe SSDs, internal capture cards, etc. And Apple also allows you to upgrade the RAM to a massive amount -- up to 1.5TB for higher-end CPU configurations.\\n\\nAll of this coupled with the plethora of external Thunderbolt 3 hardware makes the Mac Pro the most upgradable Mac ever. Simply put, it's a dream machine for Mac users, but it's also overkill for the majority.\\n\\nPro Display XDR\\n\\nSpeaking of overkill, the Pro Display XDR is a dream display for creative professionals. The true 6K display features outstanding contrast ratio and brightness ability beyond anything in its class.\\n\\nWorth mentioning is the Pro Display XDR's amazing build quality, with the optional $999 Pro Stand, which puts every other monitor that I've ever used to shame -- even Apple's beloved Thunderbolt Display.\\n\\nThe 32-inch glossy display does a great job of rejecting reflections, but it also comes with a nano-texture glass matte option that takes light rejection to the next level. Of course, the nano-texture glass option will cost you an extra $999.\\n\\nNeedless to say, this is the type of display primarily aimed at creative professionals who edit video or render 3D models all day. The 6K resolution gives you an enormous amount of flexibility for post-production, and the extreme dynamic range, which provides insane contrast, color, and brightness capabilities, is like no other display within the ballpark of its price range.\\n\\nI'm super-happy that the Pro Display XDR exists, because it shows just how seriously Apple is taking professional Mac workflows. That all being said, it's admittedly overkill for the average user, and like the Mac Pro, its price is downright prohibitive for most consumers.\\n\\n9to5Mac's Take\\n\\nAlthough Mac hardware is at its healthiest level in years (perhaps ever?), there are definitely some areas that I'd like to see Apple address going forward.\\n\\nFirst and foremost -- don't release the throttle. The Mac got in the bad shape that it did a few years ago because Apple got complacent, and focused too much on iOS to see how bad the Mac had eroded. Please never let that occur again. Keep pushing our periodic updates, no matter how mundane they may seem. Customers appreciate not having to buy outdated hardware, so continue to push out regular spec bump updates as much as possible.\\n\\nSecond: Listen to customer feedback. If Apple would have just listened to the outpouring of complaints about the original 12-inch MacBook keyboard, it would have known how seriously flawed the butterfly switch keyboard was. It thus (hopefully) would have never migrated such a terrible keyboard it to its most popular Mac lineup.\\n\\nGive us more affordable hardware. I love the Mac Pro, the iMac Pro, and the Pro Display XDR, but realistically, they are often beyond the means of the most die-hard Apple fans. As such, we need things like:\\n\\nA brand-new affordable Thunderbolt Display with great build quality, perhaps in a 5K resolution A cheaper Mac Pro iteration with PCIe and Memory access\\n\\nIn the meantime, I'd also like to see the return of the 12-inch MacBook sans butterfly keyboard, and of course, I'd like to see every Mac laptop ditch the butterfly switch keyboard in due time.\\n\\nNeedless to say, the future of Mac hardware seems very bright. Rumor has it that we'll see both a refreshed Mac mini and a refreshed iMac very soon, and of course, we should see other models in Apple's MacBook lineup receive updates as well.\\n\\nWhat do you think about the state of Mac hardware in 2020? Do you think Apple has done a good job over the last few years to correct the mistakes and missteps that it made in the past? How are you feeling about the future of Mac hardware?

       "    'title': \"Meet Jerry Manock, the father of Apple's Industrial Design Group\",\n",
       "    'body': 'Jerry Manock is one of the great unsung heroes of Apple design. As the father of Apple\\'s Industrial Design Group, Manock made an indelible contribution to the company\\'s long line of hit products.\\n\\nHe may not be a household name like Jony Ive, but, starting with the Apple II, Manock played a massive role in making the company what it is today. In an exclusive interview with Cult of Mac, the 76-year-old industrial designer recounts many colorful stories about Cupertino\\'s past -- including one that shows even Steve Jobs got nostalgic.\\n\\nManock was Apple\\'s first proper industrial designer. He designed the case for several iconic Apple computers, including the Apple II and the original Macintosh. A graduate of Stanford University, Manock had just launched his career as a freelance industrial designer when, in 1977, he got a call from Steve Jobs, co-founder of a new startup.\\n\\n\"It wasn\\'t a case of thinking, \\'What am I getting into with Apple?\\'\" Manock told Cult of Mac. \"It was more like this was another electronic project design I could do really easily.\"\\n\\nAt the time, he could never have imagined how significant a part of his life Apple would become.\\n\\nJobs wanted Manock, then in his early 30s, to build a case for the Apple II.\\n\\nAlthough personal computers were still geeky tools for hobbyists, Jobs wanted something that looked beautifully machined, as if it had rolled off a conveyor belt at some high-end factory. He also wanted it in just two months.\\n\\nOthers had already turned down the job. Manock took it. He quoted Jobs $1,800 -- and even offered him a discount if Apple paid him within 10 days.\\n\\nIn the end, Jobs didn\\'t pay on time but, when he did pay, Manock saw that he had paid only the discount price, with an additional fraction of that cost added for every day Jobs had overran on payment. It was a sneaky move, although entirely in keeping with Jobs at the time.\\n\\nThe Apple II became a powerhouse hit for Apple. Manock laughed as he recalled trying to retroactively negotiate a royalty rate of $1 for every Apple II sold following the computer\\'s massive success.\\n\\n\"I mean, how stupid can you get to try to negotiate a royalty agreement after the fact?\" he said. \"I can\\'t imagine how dumb that also sounded to [Steve]. We were walking back from a restaurant after lunch. He didn\\'t even break his stride. He said to me, \\'If you knew how many Apple IIs we\\'re going to sell next year, you\\'d know that I can\\'t do that. You\\'re good. But you\\'re not that good.\"\\n\\nManock was offered a job as Apple\\'s fifth employee. However, he insisted that he stick to working as a freelancer on an hourly rate. When Apple went public in December 1980, Manock said the person who actually became the company\\'s fifth employee was worth $75 million overnight.\\n\\n\"Oh my goodness,\" Manock said. \"I\\'ve had some people ask me if I\\'m upset about that. But Apple treated me really well. I don\\'t have any regrets at all about what I did and what could have been. They were very generous in giving bonuses out for work that Jobs considered good work. They treated me well.\"\\n\\nNot every Apple computer Manock designed became a massive hit. After the Apple II, he worked on the notorious flop known as the Apple III. Although he remains happy with the appearance of the computer -- which looks like a continuation of the Apple II design language -- the machine proved prone to failures. This lack of reliability ultimately ruined user confidence in the Apple III.\\n\\n\"The Apple III was introduced at a computer conference in Anaheim, California,\" Manock said. \"For the introduction, Jobs wanted to put on a free night for 25,000 off his best friends at [the nearby] Disneyland. They closed Disneyland, kicked everybody out. You had to have a special Apple pass to get in. I guess that was something where they said, \\'Well, we just can\\'t change that. We can\\'t cancel it. We\\'re not going to, you know, say the computer isn\\'t ready and still has some problems.\\' They just went ahead and introduced it because they had this fantastic event for everybody. And that was obviously a mistake in hindsight.\"\\n\\nBy the early 1980s, Manock officially joined Apple as corporate manager of product design. He went on to work on a project called the Macintosh, one of history\\'s most famous personal computers. (He\\'s one of the creators who had their names inscribed on the first Macs because, as Steve Jobs said, real artists sign their work.)\\n\\n\"I don\\'t hesitate at all in saying that the Macintosh was the greatest pleasure,\" Manock said. \"They had money to spend on design. Steve never questioned spending whatever it would take to get the excellence in design that he wanted. I didn\\'t have to beg for money to do the tooling and be able to make prototypes and models. It was overall incredible acceptance, and very, very gratifying.\"\\n\\nThe Mac is the design Manock is most proud of at Apple. It\\'s instantly recognizable -- friendly and approachable, but also iconic in its shape. It\\'s the Volkswagen bug of computers.\\n\\nLike a lot of the Macintosh team, Manock left Apple after the first Mac shipped. He felt burned out. He moved with his wife and kids to Burlington, Vermont -- about as far away from the madcap bustle of Silicon Valley as you could hope for. Originally, they planned to stay for six months. They still live in Burlington today, and Manock still runs his own design company there.\\n\\nManock exchanged the occasional email with Jobs, about three per year. On one occasion, he suggested Jobs fly into Burlington on one of his trips from California to New York.\\n\\n\"At that time, he was recognized wherever he went,\" Manock said. \"He\\'d get surrounded by this mob of people. I said that you could walk down Church Street and, while people might recognize you, they wouldn\\'t bother you.\" But Jobs declined the offer and said he\\'d rather spend time with his family.\\n\\nThen, in the mid-2000s, Manock came to San Francisco. He had held onto around 35 Apple shares over the years, and decided to go to one of the annual shareholders meetings with his wife. Manock didn\\'t bother Jobs by telling him he would be in town. He and his wife went to the meeting and sat in the fourth or fifth row.\\n\\n\"When Steve came out, I saw him kind of scanning the audience, and he saw me there,\" Manock said. \"He gave my wife and I this little three-finger wave, just a very, very subtle acknowledgement that we were there. I thought that was kind of neat.\"\\n\\nThen, as the meeting wrapped up, something happened that Manock said \"just totally blew my mind.\" Jobs addressed the shareholders and said, \"Before we break up for today, I just want to acknowledge two people in the audience.\" He then motioned to Manock and his wife sitting in the audience.\\n\\nTelling the story, Manock choked up. \"Oh, geez, I\\'m getting teary just talking about it,\" he said. \"He mentioned, you know, my contribution to the Apple II, Apple III and the Macintosh. And I got a standing ovation.\"\\n\\nIt was the last time Manock ever saw Jobs.\\n\\nContrary to what you might expect, Manock said he doesn\\'t receive much in the way of correspondence from Apple. If there\\'s a list of former employees who get sent the latest gadgets, Apple\\'s first industrial designer is not on it.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been waiting for them to send one of those $55,000 Mac Pros,\" he laughed. But it also makes him a bit sad. \"Apple has a pretty long history of totally ignoring their past,\" he said. \"Which is very, very sad -- but so it is.\"\\n\\nSeveral years ago, Manock and some other early Apple employees arranged to visit Apple and Jony Ive, the company\\'s longtime guru of industrial design. (Ive retired from Apple in 2019 to go solo.)\\n\\nThe day before their visit, Manock\\'s group received an email from Ive\\'s executive assistant saying that their meeting had been scrubbed. \"There was no reason or anything, just [a message] that our meeting is canceled,\" Manock said.\\n\\nDespite being the oldest and most storied of the current tech giants, Apple doesn\\'t exactly pay homage to its past. There\\'s the odd shot of a vintage PowerBook at an Apple keynote, but for the most part Cupertino doesn\\'t do much to celebrate its history. But, whether it wants to or not, there\\'s a design through line that runs from the very first Apple II computers through the Mac all the way to the latest iPhones.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think there\\'s a specific design detail [that\\'s mine], but when I look at my iPhone in front of me, it sort of invites interaction,\" Manock said. \"That\\'s something I always tried to do. It\\'s one of those general design guidelines that I think have been carried over.\"',\n",

       "    'title': 'Apple dips toes into lower-priced waters with colorful $99 iPhone 5C',\n",
       "    'body': 'Apple CEO Tim Cook and other executives today unveiled the iPhone 5S and the plastic-backed iPhone 5C, the first time in the six-year history of the iconic smartphone that the company has gone with a two-tier strategy.\\n\\nUnlike last year, there were some surprises during the 80-min. presentation, which took place at Apple\\'s Cupertino, Calif. headquarters.\\n\\n\"I was surprised by the 64-bit processor and the motion processor,\" said Ezra Gottheil, analyst with Technology Business Research, in an interview after Apple\\'s event. He was referring to the faster Apple-designed A7 SoC (system on a chip) that will power the iPhone 5S, and its new motion data processor, which Apple touted as the foundation for a new wave of health and fitness apps.\\n\\n\"Overall, the 5S is a nice step up, they did things that made sense, but there\\'s not a lot of avenues left now to take a smartphone,\" Gottheil said.\\n\\nFor his third iPhone introduction since taking the reins from co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011, Cook kept to tradition by kicking off the event, then introducing other Apple executives to handle the heavy lifting.\\n\\n\"In the past, we\\'ve lowered the price of the current iPhone, making it accessible to more people. This year, we\\'re not going to do that,\" said Cook. \"The business has become so large, so this year we\\'re going to replace the iPhone 5. This allows us to serve even more customers.\"\\n\\nThe replacement for the iPhone 5 will be the frequently-leaked iPhone 5C, essentially a repackaged iPhone 5 that comes in five colors, its chassis composed of polycarbonate -- not the milled aluminum featured in flagships -- with a steel frame that doubles as an antenna.\\n\\nLike the iPhone 5 and its 2013 replacement, the iPhone 5C boasts a 4-in. screen with an 1,136-x-640-pixel resolution and relies on the Lightning connectivity technology for connecting to a computer, charger or accessories. It boasts the A6, the same SoC (system on a chip) used by last year\\'s iPhone 5.\\n\\nBecause of the introduction of the iPhone 5C, Apple will scale back but not ditch the practice of retaining previous-generation models, which it has sold at $99 with a contract for the past year\\'s phone. In the case of the two-year-old model, Apple has asked for zero down when customers sign a two-year contract.\\n\\nThe iPhone 5 and iPhone 4 will be retired, but the iPhone 4S will continue to be the bottom-end model, offered free with a contract.\\n\\nThe iPhone 5C will go on sale Sept. 20 at prices of $99 for a 16GB device and $199 for 32GB; those prices assume a two-year carrier contract. Minus a contract, or sold \"unlocked,\" the lower-end iPhone 5C will cost approximately $550, while the 32GB will run $650.\\n\\nThose prices were considerably higher than most analysts\\' expectations. They had assumed Apple would sell the iPhone 5C at dramatically lower prices -- the lowest estimates were around $300 unsubsidized by a contract -- to battle even cheaper Android smartphones in major markets like China and India, where the Google mobile OS has been trumping iOS in sales volume and market share.\\n\\nTurned out Apple didn\\'t want to play that game.\\n\\n\"So, optimisation of the existing strategy. Not a new pricing strategy,\" tweeted Benedict Evans, an analyst with U.K.-based Ender Analysis.\\n\\n\"Apple isn\\'t interested in giving away its technology,\" said Carolina Milanesi of Gartner in an interview. \"They are staying true to their core [on the 5C and its pricing] \"Maybe we will see another, less expensive device later, but clearly Apple felt it wasn\\'t the right time to do that.\"\\n\\nThe five colors of the new iPhone 5C are seen on screen at Apple\\'s media event in Cupertino, Calif. (Photo: Stephen Lam/Reuters)\\n\\nIn Apple\\'s pricing structure, the 5C substitutes for the iPhone 5, which if the firm had fallen back on last year\\'s model, would have been priced at $99 with a two-year contract, or $550 without.\\n\\nOf course, it is a new iPhone, not last year\\'s, which is what Apple has been selling at that price. Milanesi was convinced that would boost sales, but wasn\\'t ready to predict by how much. \"I do think that [the newness] makes a difference,\" she said. \"Here you have the colors, so it becomes more about the variety. I think this was a smart move as well.\"\\n\\nMilanesi characterized Apple\\'s iPhone 5C pricing and specification decisions as resulting in higher-than-anticipated prices, but with hardware that was better than expected.\\n\\nStill, some were clearly disappointed in Apple\\'s refusal to go lower.\\n\\n\"This won\\'t move the needle in emerging markets,\" said Gottheil, one of a crowd of analysts who had bet Apple would be more interested in gaining back some market share than in high profit margins. \"It appears they were afraid lower prices would cannibalize the iPhone 5S in the subsidized markets.\"\\n\\nPhilip Schiller, head of Apple marketing, took the stage to introduce both the iPhone 5C and the 5S, the latter the company\\'s newest flagship. \"It\\'s the most forward-thinking phone we\\'ve ever created,\" said Schiller of the iPhone 5S. \"It\\'s the most forward-thinking phone anyone\\'s ever made.\"\\n\\nAs expected, Apple stuck with the \"S\" designation for the follow-up to 2012\\'s iPhone 5, which sported a new design.\\n\\nOn the outside, the iPhone 5S looks almost identical to the iPhone 5, although it comes in a new gold-tinted \"champagne\" color as well as something Schiller called \"space gray.\"\\n\\nInside, the iPhone 5S relies on an Apple-designed A7 chip, Apple\\'s first 64-bit processor, that Schiller said was twice as fast as the A6 in last year\\'s phone, and with double the graphics performance. As has been its habit, Apple did not reveal the A7\\'s clock speed or the number of cores it contains. The iPhone 5S also has a longer-lasting battery that will run 10 hours of LTE talk time, Wi-Fi browsing or video play, and up to 40 hours of music.\\n\\nPhil Schiller, Apple senior vice president of worldwide marketing, reveals the iPhone 5S Touch ID fingerprint recognition feature. (Photo: Stephen Lam/Reuters)\\n\\nA new motion processor, dubbed the M7, is also tucked inside the iPhone 5S and continuously measures motion data generated by the built-in accelerometer, gyroscope and compass. Schiller said it and the new CoreMotion API in iOS 7 would kick start a new wave of health and fitness apps.\\n\\nMilanesi and Gottheil saw the motion processor as the foundation for more ambitious moves in wearable computing, the category that pundits have predicted will eventually result in an \"iWatch\" device worn on the wrist.\\n\\n\"Absolutely,\" said Milanesi when asked if the 5S\\'s motion processor was a precursor to bigger things. \"It\\'s clear that they are working on something, but haven\\'t figured it out yet. In the meantime, they\\'re giving you something you can use now. More importantly, they\\'ll learn what users want and what kind of apps can be developed [for wearables].\"\\n\\nAnother new feature of the iPhone 5S trumpeted by Schiller was the long-rumored fingerprint scanner. Dubbed Touch ID, it\\'s based on a capacitor built into the Home button on the bottom front of the iPhone 5S. \"Touch ID reads your fingerprint at an incredibly detailed level,\" Schiller claimed.\\n\\nApple said Touch ID would be used to unlock an owner\\'s iPhone, as well as for authenticating iTunes purchases without a password. The fingerprint data will be encrypted and locked inside the phone\\'s A7 SoC, not stored on Apple\\'s servers or backed up to its iCloud sync service.\\n\\nThe iPhone 5S will also go on sale Sept. 20 in Apple\\'s retail stores. The first wave of markets -- the U.S., Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore and the U.K. -- will be followed by enough others to reach 100 countries by December, Cook said. Carrier partners and some authorized resellers will also begin selling it Sept. 20, as well.\\n\\nOnline and phone pre-orders (for the iPhone 5C only) will start three days from now, on Friday, Sept. 13.\\n\\nThe iPhone 5S will be priced in the U.S. at $199 for a 16GB model, $299 for 32GB, and $399 for 64GB of storage space, the now-standard prices; all assume a two-year contract with a carrier.\\n\\nDuring today\\'s event, Craig Federighi, who heads all OS development at Apple after the company pushed out Scott Forstall last year, demonstrated several of the 200-some new features of iOS 7, which will power the iPhone 5S and 5C, including improved search, a single-swipe to bring up the control panel, and tweaks to the Siri digital assistant.\\n\\nThe first radical overhaul of Apple\\'s mobile operating system since its inception, iOS 7 features a \"flatter\" design with fewer three-dimensional cues, and a complete or partial elimination of \"skeuomorphic\" embellishments, like the wooden bookshelves in iBooks and the lined paper in Notes.\\n\\nThe free iOS 7 upgrade -- which will be available to owners of iPhone 4 and later, the iPad 2 and later, and the fifth-generation iPod Touch -- will debut Sept 18, two days before the iPhone 5S and 5C reach retail and customers who pre-order.\\n\\nCook also spent a few minutes announcing that all new iOS buyers will be able to download free copies of the iPhone and iPad versions of Apple\\'s iWork suite. The three apps -- Pages, Numbers and Keynote -- have been priced at $9.99 each.\\n\\nThe give-away followed an announcement this summer that Apple had created online editions of those apps, called iWork for iCloud, to compete more effectively with Google and Microsoft in the mobile productivity market.\\n\\nGottheil assumed that the freeing of the iOS apps meant that iWork for iCloud will also be offered gratis to customers. Currently, iWork for iCloud is in beta, although anyone with an iCloud account may try them out.\\n\\nBut for all the interesting additions to the flagship -- and the pricing of the 5C -- Apple failed to really come up with a \"wow\" moment, a problem critics have used to claim that the company has lost its innovation edge. \"They took the 5S in reasonable directions,\" said Gottheil, sounding less than enthusiastic about the overall presentation.\\n\\nMilanesi felt the same way during the event, but on reflection, she changed her mind. \"Apple has added stuff that is difficult to articulate, but once you look at it, there\\'s a lot here, even though there\\'s not a \\'Wow\\' thing. Apple\\'s not taken the easy road.\"\\n\\nPhil Schiller, Apple\\'s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, explains pricing for the iPhone 5C.

       "    'title': 'Apple Card Updates Privacy Policy to Allow for More Anonymized Data Sharing',\n",
       "    'body': 'When Apple announced its Apple Card nearly a year ago, it seemed like an alright card whose main selling point was enhanced privacy. Well with iOS 13.4, it appears that Apple has updated that privacy to allow for more anonymized data sharing with its banking partner Goldman Sachs.\\n\\nBefore you grab a virtual pitchfork, screaming about how it was inevitable that morally bankrupt Goldman Sachs would get its mitts on your data -- it\\'s a little more nuanced than that. The changes, which were first reported by TechCrunch, are more tweaks to its existing policy than a stealth attack to upend your privacy.\\n\\nThe new policy is part of iOS 13.4 updates, and here\\'s the part that\\'s been changed:\\n\\nYou may be eligible for certain Apple Card programs provided by Goldman Sachs based on the information provided as part of your application. Apple may know whether you receive the invitation to participate and whether you accept or decline the invitation, and may share that information with Goldman Sachs to effectuate the program. Apple will not know additional details about your participation in the program.\\n\\nApple may use information about your account with Apple, such as the fact that you have Apple Card, for internal research and analytics purposes, such as financial forecasting. Apple may also use information about your relationship with Apple, such as what Apple products you have purchased, how long you have had your Apple ID, and how often you transact with Apple, to improve Apple Card by helping to identify Apple metrics that may assist Goldman Sachs in improving credit decisioning. No personally identifiable information about your relationship with Apple will be shared with Goldman Sachs to identify the relevant Apple metrics. You can opt out of this use or your Apple relationship information by emailing our privacy team at dpo@apple.com with the subject line \"Apple Relationship Data and Apple Card.\" Applicants and cardholders may be able to choose to share the identified metrics with Goldman Sachs for re-evaluation of their offer of credit or to increase their credit line. Apple may share information about your relationship with Apple with our service providers, who are obligated to handle the information consistent with this notice and Apple instructions, are required to use reasonable security measures to protect any personal information received, and must delete the personal information as soon as they have completed the services.\"\\n\\nLooking at this there are a few things to note. First, Goldman Sachs is getting a richer data set, but nothing that contains personally identifiable information. (But as many experts have pointed out, anonymized data isn\\'t always so anonymous.) The changed text also states some of the expanded data shared might be used to help Goldman Sachs in \"improving credit decisioning.\" That\\'s key here. When the Apple Card launched, there were several anecdotal discrepancies with who got approved, who didn\\'t, and what terms people got. Famously, Steve Wozniak took to Twitter to highlight how he ended up getting a credit limit that was 10 times that of his wife, despite them both sharing their assets. (Goldman Sachs quickly backpedaled.)\\n\\nSo part of the reason Apple is sharing more data -- albeit anonymized data -- is to create a new model that would allow more people who\\'d be rejected under the old model to obtain credit. This is one of those things where normally, that\\'d be a sign for alarm but in this specific case, it might be okay. It was worrisome when it appeared that Goldman Sachs was approving subprime applicants right after the card launched. However, having used the Apple Card myself, the limits are fairly low, the rates are fine, and there is a built-in tool that helps you visualize how your payments impact interest.\\n\\nApple gets some kudos for creating a new \"Customer Assistance Program\" for those affected financially by the novel coronavirus, in which interest charges are voided for customers who can\\'t make their March payments. It\\'s a testament to how much say Apple has over the card itself, as no capitalist bank would do this sort of thing if not mandated by the government. In fact, Citigroup passed on the Apple Card as it thought it was a \\'money loser.\\' And hey, what better time to increase the anonymous data sharing in a program than at the same moment when you\\'re announcing a program to help people impacted by the coronavirus?\\n\\nIt\\'s also important to keep in mind that Goldman Sachs has always had access to Apple Card customer data -- though, not transaction details. Apple\\'s site states that Goldman Sachs uses your data to operate the card, but will never \"share or sell your data to third parties for marketing or advertising.\" Whether you believe that or not, the Apple Card disclosure is better than most other credit card agreements. (Of course, what Goldman Sachs does with your data internally is another matter.)\\n\\nSecond, the policy updates still allow users to opt-in or out of sharing more personal data if they\\'re rejected for the card. This also isn\\'t a new thing -- it\\'ll just now include more data like what Apple products you\\'ve purchased in the past, when you created your Apple ID, or how much you spend on Apple. You still get to opt-out of sending that information -- even though burying it as an email in a privacy statement is kinda lame.\\n\\nSo all this is just to say that when it comes to usage, not much is changing with the Apple Card. It\\'s still a mediocre card when it comes to rewards -- and privacy-wise, it is better than other credit cards out there even with these changes. That\\'s just an incredibly low bar because banks are bad. Still, it pays to keep an eye on these changes and remember that even the best credit cards are still operated by shitty, money-grubbing banks.',\n",

(Goldman Sachs quickly backpedaled.)\\n\\nSo part of the reason Apple is sharing more data -- albeit anonymised data -- is to create a new model that would allow more people who\\'d be rejected under the old model to obtain credit. This is one of those things where normally, that\\'d be a sign for alarm but in this specific case, it might be ok. It was worrisome when it appeared that Goldman Sachs was approving subprime applicants right after the card launched. However, having used the Apple Card myself, the limits are fairly low, the rates are fine, and there is a built-in tool that helps you visualise how your payments impact interest.\\n\\nApple gets some kudos for creating a new \"Customer Assistance Program\" for those affected financially by the novel coronavirus, in which interest charges are voided for customers who can\\'t make their March payments. It\\'s a testament to how much say Apple has over the card itself, as no capitalist bank would do this sort of thing if not mandated by the government. In fact, Citigroup passed on the Apple Card as it thought it was a \\'money loser.\\' And hey, what better time to increase the anonymous data sharing in a program than at the same moment when you\\'re announcing a program to help people impacted by the coronavirus?\\n\\nIt\\'s also important to keep in mind that Goldman Sachs has always had access to Apple Card customer data -- though, not transaction details. Apple\\'s site states that Goldman Sachs uses your data to operate the card, but will never \"share or sell your data to third parties for marketing or advertising.\" Whether you believe that or not, the Apple Card disclosure is better than most other credit card agreements. (Of course, what Goldman Sachs does with your data internally is another matter.)\\n\\nSecond, the policy updates still allow users to opt-in or out of sharing more personal data if they\\'re rejected for the card. This also isn\\'t a new thing -- it\\'ll just now include more data like what Apple products you\\'ve purchased in the past, when you created your Apple ID, or how much you spend on Apple. You still get to opt-out of sending that information -- even though burying it as an email in a privacy statement is kinda lame.\\n\\nSo all this is just to say that when it comes to usage, not much is changing with the Apple Card. It\\'s still a mediocre card when it comes to rewards -- and privacy-wise, it is better than other credit cards out there even with these changes. That\\'s just an incredibly low bar because banks are bad. Still, it pays to keep an eye on these changes and remember that even the best credit cards are still operated by shitty, money-grubbing banks.',\n",

       "    'body': 'Apple currently trading slightly below fair value.\\n\\nFundamentals remain intact.\\n\\nLeverage COVID-19 fears to your advantage.\\n\\nDon\\'t be an Apple bear.\\n\\nApple has closed all of its stores outside China. iPhone assembling is nowhere near what it used to be three months ago. Apple is also being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for monopolistic activities. Despite all of these headwinds, I believe Apple is poised for a strong recovery given the underlying quality of the business. In other words, it is worth more than its price. After a review of the current market outlook, Apple\\'s business strategy and applicable risk factors, I risked myself into valuing Apple. The exercise proved worthwhile as my valuation indicates that the company is (slightly) undervalued.\\n\\nCOVID-19 really shook markets these last weeks: Monday (March 9, 2020) was quite historical but Black Thursday and Monday (March 16, 2020) will make history for 2020. Especially Monday (March 16, 2020), since the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all managed to fall by more than 12%. Quite spectacular to be honest. As Paul Krugman says in his MasterClass trailer, \"we live in strange times.\" Fear is taking over financial markets and that means that some investors (let\\'s call them the \"fearful people\") will seek to unload their stock positions as quickly as possible and at any price to willing buyers (let\\'s call them the \"fearless people\"). This means that (very) good bargains can now be found more easily than before. And indeed, some renowned investment managers (think Icahn Enterprises L.P. or Ark Invest) are already putting money to work.\\n\\nIn that environment, I argue that stocks currently present a very compelling buy argument. That is even truer considering the quality of some of the companies currently \"on sale.\" Let us thus rely on Buffett\\'s advice:\"Opportunities come infrequently. When it rains gold, put out the bucket, not the thimble.\"\\n\\nGiven Apple\\'s business quality, I asked myself whether the recent drop in the stock price, presents an interesting opportunity on the long side (unlevered purchase of shares). The latest investor update seems to indicate that no bargain can be found: \"iPhone supply shortages will temporarily affect revenues worldwide\" and \"demand for our products within China has been affected\" while Apple\\'s Newsroom provides some bleak information: \"We will be closing all of our retail stores outside of Greater China until March 27.\" However, bargains are found in bear markets not bull markets.\\n\\nApple relies primarily on its iPhone business segment to generate sales (indeed, iPhones represented roughly 55% of total net sales in FY2019: 142,381/260,471 55%). As a result, any reduction in the number of iPhones sold worldwide or any drop in the profitability of each smartphone sold can severely impact total net sales. On top of that, add the fact that equipment (I am referring to the hardware here) is not so different from that of competitors (which generally offer a cheaper smartphone) and you can have significant competition risk.\\n\\nHowever, over the years, Apple has engaged in various efforts to maintain its customer base and attract new customers, thus cementing its moat. First, the iOS went through several updates improving upon each version. This led to renewed consumer interest plus increased cross-selling: if you have an iPhone, your life is going to be a lot easier if you also have a Mac, Apple Music etc. Second, and more importantly, Apple spent a lot of time and efforts developing two increasingly important business lines: Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services. Those two segments have recently helped Apple diversify its revenue mix away from the iPhone (2019 results would have been a lot more catastrophic without those two segments).\\n\\nIn short, Apple sells you hardware, software and third-party applications through as many \"terminals\" (iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, etc.) as possible. The idea being 1) to have the best customer experience and 2) to make it really difficult/painful to leave the Apple ecosystem (if you don\\'t like it). Other elements that make the company immensely valuable (and justify a premium valuation more on that later) include an iconic brand, an all-star management team, shareholder friendly policies and a pristine balance sheet. Now, onto the many risk factors.\\n\\nLooking at Apple\\'s risk factors, the following elements are listed (my personal arguments below each risk factor):\\n\\nOverall, three main risks should preoccupy Apple\\'s senior management: COVID-19 (manufacturing issues), COVID-19 (distribution impacts), and the ongoing legal investigation by the DOJ. I believe those headwinds are overly priced into the stock. Thus, Apple presents an interesting value opportunity as we will see in the next section.\\n\\nWith respect to revenues, I pulled Apple\\'s last three years of sales from its investor relation section. Note that I used net sales by category for 2019, 2018 and 2017. You could also have net sales broken down geographically or just do your own personal breakdown. Projecting up to 2024, I am putting most of the stress on the iPhone and Mac lines for the years 2020 and 2021. If COVID-19 is similar to SARS, then within 18 months we should expect to have an operational vaccine. I thus used growth rates of -4% and +2% of growth for 2020 and 2021 for the iPhone segment. For the Mac segment, I used -2% and +1%. I cut to zero the growth for iPad, Wearables and Services segments in 2020 and subsequently gave them lower than historical growth rates to remain conservative. The full picture is as such:Source: Apple\\'s 2019 10K Report, Yahoo Finance and Author\\'s calculations\\n\\nSource: Apple\\'s 2019 10K Report, Yahoo Finance and Author\\'s calculations\\n\\nNote: in blue you have hardcoded/historical numbers. In Black you have formulas and in red you have the assumptions used for the years 2020-2024.\\n\\nWith respect to cost of sales, I simply assumed that those will be in line with 2019: 62.2% of net sales (one could go a little further here and try to allocate cost of sales by segment. I will not do that here as I do not have enough insights on the cost structure). This assumption gives me a stable gross margin of 37.8% which is really not bad for a business the size of Apple:\\n\\nI proceeded similarly for operating expenses, maintaining 13.2% of operating expenses (as a % of net sales) from 2020 to 2024:\\n\\nWith respect to other income, I noticed that interest and dividend income have sequentially decreased while interest expense progressively increased. As a result, I projected from 2020 to 2024 the minimum of 2019, 2018 and 2017 as total other income. I also used 15.9% as Apple\\'s effective tax rate. Now this is quite an optimistic projection considering that tax rates may change in the future (particularly if there are changes in the White House) but I remained fairly conservative with the rest of my assumptions so I\\'ll live with that (also, I really don\\'t know how to predict the future so there you have it). Overall, this gave me a net income which average for the 2020-2024 period of approximately USD 59B, similar to what Apple earned in for FY 2018:\\n\\nI derived EBITDA and EBIT from Operating Income and assumed depreciation & amortization equal to 4.8% of net sales (anyone who has a better way of calculating this item is welcome to post it as a comment below the article):\\n\\nSource: Apple\\'s 2019 10K Report, Yahoo Finance and Author\\'s calculations\\n\\nFrom there, I calculated EBIAT, added back depreciation and amortization and subtracted CapEx and NWC. Note that a full analysis typically includes in addition to the three standard financial statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet Statement and Cash Flow Statement) a debt schedule and a working capital schedule (other elements can also have their own schedules). In the interest of time, and to remain conservative, I took the average of the last three years for CapEx (which I find adequate) and the maximum over the last three years for Net working capital (\"NWC\") which I also find adequate (although on the conservative side as mentioned). This gave me unlevered free cash flows in line with Apple\\'s historical results:\\n\\nI used two methods to calculate Apple\\'s value via Discounted Cash Flow analysis: the EBITDA multiple method and the Free Cash Flow in perpetuity methods:\\n\\nI do not believe Apple could be ever taken private (at least not in the foreseeable future), thus I did not perform a Precedent Transaction analysis. However, I did perform a Comparable Company analysis which relied on an equal-weighted blend of relevant U.S. blue chips (see table below). Note that the multiples used here match in type with those I used in my DCF analysis (EV/EBITDA and P/FCF). Finally, for illustration purposes, I also included the most likely price that Buffett paid for the overall stake in Apple (refer to this link for further details).\\n\\nSource: QTrade, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Finance, Author\\'s calculations\\n\\nGraphically, it looks like this:\\n\\nSource: QTrade, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Finance, Author\\'s calculations\\n\\nWith all that has been written, please note that there is still a scenario where Apple could experience manufacturing issues while facing weaker demand for its products and services and on top of that be actively targeted by antitrust enforcement actions. I believe this scenario is unlikely (although those scenarios may occur one after the other). Still, Apple has demonstrated its ability to survive tough times in the past and will continue to do so in the future.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe (and I may be wrong here) that Apple is currently close to fair value (slightly undervalued to be specific). Any further drop in the stock price (around $220-260) caused by COVID-19 fears present an interesting opportunity for profits post virus (probably FY 2021) everything else constant.

       "    'title': \"Would Apple actually be crazy enough to kill the Beats brand? It's complicated\",\n",
       "    'body': 'Out of all of the companies Apple has purchased over the years, Beats was the most perplexing. Not only was it a whopping $3.2 billion, it also brought a highly recognized brand under the Apple umbrella, along with some very high profile personalities, including Jimmy Iovine, Dr. Dre, and Trent Reznor, all of whom have moved on from prominent roles within the company.\\n\\nBut it all kind of worked. At the time, the brass ring in the Beats purchase wasn\\'t the ultra-trendy cans, it was the Beats Music subscription service that had a small but loyal cadre of listeners. Barely a year after the acquisition was finalized, Beats Music morphed into Apple Music, and some 60 million subscribers later, it clearly worked out. Apple Music is one of the premium listening experiences out there, with plenty of room to grow.\\n\\nOver the years, Apple Music has basically extinguished any trace of the soul of Beats Music. While some visual throwbacks remain and the hand-curated playlists are still a thing, Apple Music is most definitely a product for Apple users. Yes, there\\'s an Android version, but Apple doesn\\'t market Apple Music to buyers of the original Beats in any way. In fact, you won\\'t even find a single mention of it on the Beats by Dre site.\\n\\nYou will, however, find headphones. Lots of them. Since Apple\\'s acquisition, Beats has actually expanded its headphone offerings and now sells nine different sets of headphones, ranging from the wired urBeats 3 for $60 to the Studio 3 Wireless for $350. But there\\'s no mistaking the Apple influence. The Powerbeats Pro charge with a Lightning cable. The new Powerbeats have Apple\\'s H1 and W1 chip for easy pairing, and support hands-free Siri commands. And of course, purchase buttons on the Beats website send you straight to the Apple Store.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s where you\\'ll find Apple\\'s own offerings: AirPods and AirPods Pro. For $159, $199, and $250, you can buy a pair of Apple\\'s extremely popular and instantly recognizable true wireless earbuds that pair instantly with your iPhone and offer more than 24 hours of listening time with their charging case.\\n\\nNow there are strong indications that Apple is looking to expand its line of headphones. Rumors have been circulating for months about Apple\\'s over-ear headphones, but a recent flurry of reports seems to indicate that they will be arriving sooner rather than later. First, there was a leaked Target product listing for AirPods (X Generation). Then 9to5Mac uncovered an icon in an early iOS 14 build that depicted an unreleased pair of studio headphones. And finally, Jon Prosser on Twitter teased the WWDC launch of Apple\\'s over-ear headphones for WWDC and AirPods X \"for sports/running\" later in the fall.\\n\\nBut Prosser also threw in an intriguing bit of commentary as part of his leak: \"End goal: phase out Beats.\" Prosser told Macworld that his source pitched that as the \"long-term\" goal, so it\\'s not like he\\'s saying it will happen anytime soon. Meanwhile, 9to5Mac has since thrown some cold water on Prosser\\'s claim, saying that killing Beats \"is not (a strategy) that should be viewed as being on the table for Apple.\"\\n\\nBut I think they\\'re both right. No, Apple isn\\'t going to shut Beats down tomorrow or even this year. But yes, it\\'s the plan for the future. Even if we reach the day where Beats doesn\\'t exist anymore, its DNA is forever entwined with Apple\\'s.\\n\\nApple\\'s beating drum\\n\\nApple has owned Beats for the better part of six years now, and it\\'s clear that the purchase has more than paid off. Apple Music and AirPods have obviously borrowed liberally from Beats\\' audio IP, but its effect can also be felt on HomePod and the speakers on the MacBook Pro. Maybe it\\'s audio output is too bass-heavy, but there\\'s no denying the impact Beats has had on Apple\\'s product line.\\n\\nIt\\'s true that Apple still makes money every time a pair of Beats headphones is sold, but it\\'s such a small piece of Apple\\'s sizable pie, it barely matters. At its peak, Beats was making $1.5 billion in revenue a year. Annual revenue is likely well under a billion now, however, which works out to around $250 million a quarter, little more than a rounding error on Apple\\'s balance sheet.\\n\\nBut still, Beats is a very visible brand. Athletes, influencers, and musicians can still be seen wearing them, even if most of them have AirPods too. So getting rid of the brand entirely wouldn\\'t go unnoticed.\\n\\nBut as Apple continues its push into \"hearables\" and supplants more of Beats\\' popular products with its own version, more and more of the luster will begin to fade from the Beats brand. Even with an eye-watering price tag, Apple has already gotten its money worth from its Beats acquisition. I agree with Prosser that it\\'s just a matter of time.\\n\\nBesides, Apple already begun phasing out non-iPhone users with Siri and Lightning on Beats\\' most popular earphones, and if that becomes the norm, fewer and fewer Android users are going to buy them. And once that happens, few people will even notice when Apple pulls the plug on the once-iconic brand.\\n\\nNo matter what, Beats will forever be a part of Apple\\'s audio makeup. Dr. Dre and Trent Reznor may be long gone, but the impressions Beats has had on Apple will last far longer than the \"b\" logo.\\n\\nNote: When you purchase something after clicking links in our articles, we may earn a small commission.

       "    'title': 'HBO Now ends support for 3rd-gen Apple TV at end of the month, here are your options - 9to5Mac',\n",
       "    'body': 'The HBO Now and HBO Go apps are ending support for the third-generation Apple TV at the end of April. HBO announced the retirement on March 30, and a banner is now visible in the HBO app on the older Apple TV boxes.\\n\\nAlthough the third-gen Apple TV is actually an eight-year-old device at this point, released in 2012, a lot of them are still in use as the upgrade cycle for set-top boxes is much longer than it is for phones. Apple also sold that model of Apple TV for as low as $69, so it was very popular. But now, HBO is ending support as it prepares to launch its new HBO Max streaming service. So what are your options?\\n\\nThe removal of HBO Go and HBO Now affects owners of Apple TV second-generation and Apple TV third-generation. The company didn\\'t give a reason why it was ending support, but we believe it is related to a lack of modern video codec support and a desire to cut some technical baggage as HBO focuses on its brand-new HBO Max streaming initiative in May.\\n\\nIf you have a second-gen model, then you don\\'t really have any options but to buy a new streaming device: You can get a newer Apple TV or something like an Amazon Fire Stick, and use the HBO Now app on that.\\n\\nHowever, if you have the third-generation model, one possible workaround for HBO Now subscribers is to cancel your direct subscription to HBO and instead sign up through Apple TV Channels. This is because Apple added the new TV app to the third-generation Apple TV, as part of its rollout of Apple TV+. This means that HBO is available through the TV app as well.\\n\\nYou can sign up and pay for HBO on Apple TV Channels through your Apple ID for $14.99 per month, the same price as the native app. This subscription can be shared across all devices that can access the Apple TV app, and with up to six members of your family through Family Sharing.\\n\\nThe support for HBO through Apple TV Channels will continue on the third-generation Apple TV despite the service\\'s standalone app being discontinued. The channel may be rebranded when HBO Max debuts (HBO has yet to clarify its rollout plans) but the content offering will stay the same, and possibly get larger.\\n\\nThe thing is, the third-generation Apple TV is simply quite old. Apple is already on the second iteration of the modern tvOS Apple TV platform, and we expect another hardware revision of the product sometime this year. The simple fact of life is that HBO will not be the only company ending support for the \"dated\" hardware. This week, customers have also seen problems loading YouTube videos on the third-gen box, and YouTube hasn\\'t shown any expediency in fixing the issue either. Realistically, we are only going to have more of these things happen over time, not less.\\n\\nSo, if you are wanting to upgrade, what are your options?\\n\\nThe natural progression is an Apple TV 4K. It features the same deep integration with Apple services as the third-gen box and goes further with rich integration of iCloud Photos, Apple Music, and access to an App Store of apps. The App Store includes video apps like Disney+, meaning you can access video services that the old Apple TVs never could. The newer Apple TVs also let you enjoy the Apple Arcade library, and so much more. However, a number of people do not like the trackpad-based Siri Remote, and the big drawback of the modern Apple TV is the price. It\\'s simply too expensive. (Regarding the remote, the third-gen Infrared remote is also compatible with tvOS.)\\n\\nIf you don\\'t want to pay the Apple TV premium, nor wait to see what Apple has in store for the expected Apple TV hardware refresh coming sometime this year, the next best recommendation is an Amazon Fire TV Stick. For a very inexpensive price, you can get a great streaming stick for your dumb TV. And the Fire Stick has the Apple TV app, which means all your Apple TV and iTunes video purchases can come along for the ride.\\n\\nWhere to watch Apple TV+: iPhone, iPad, Mac, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, smart TVs, and more\\n\\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

       "    'body': \"By this time next year it is likely much of economic and consumer activity will have rebounded, barring a particularly negative downturn, and Apple has ample liquidity and cash but in the meantime it may experience major headwinds for a few quarters still.\\n\\nApple's (AAPL) weaknesses in the current coronavirus environment stems from its focus on consumer retail, whether for its hardware products or even to some degree its services.\\n\\nDue to shutdowns and social distancing consumers outside of China are unable to visit Apple stores or other retailers to browse and purchase Apple hardware products for an uncertain and seemingly long upcoming timeframe, likely resulting in a sharp contraction in upcoming sales for its core geographic revenue sources.\\n\\nThe skyrocketing mass unemployment also creates an environment where consumer discretionary income is likely to be squeezed. Consumers may be less apt to spend, even if they still are employed due to perhaps worries about the economic environment going forward, on a new high-strung iPhone, fancy accessories, or micro-transaction services purchases and all of which have been the major drivers of Apple's growth in recent years.\\n\\nAs shown below Apple's sales are heavily tilted towards the Americas and Europe, both of which are essentially almost entirely shut down at the moment to the ability of the consumer to peruse an Apple store and pick up one (or more) new Apple products.\\n\\nWhile Apple has re-opened all of its stores in China after only a month of shutdowns nonetheless such an optimistic timeline clearly is not in store for the bulk of the rest of its operations as it appears Apple will keep its ex-China stores closed until at least early May, marking at minimum a broad two-month closure to when its ex-China stores closed on March 13.\\n\\nApple doesn't even have necessarily a major say in when it can re-open its Apple stores ex-China. Many nations have implemented forced lockdowns closing all but essential businesses, with consumer technology retail stores like Apple being questionable as to if they fall into the permitted essential categories even if the stores try to re-open. Furthermore many Apple stores in the United States are in malls, which have either voluntarily shut down operations or were specifically told by state governments to close.\\n\\nThese hurdles make it far more likely that Apple re-opening its retail stores will be delayed, rocky, and in a patchwork format unlike its China-stores restart.\\n\\nEven if Apple stores fully re-open the economic and consumer spending environment right now, and for the upcoming future, does not look like one that will favor Apple. The fact that in two weeks the U.S. posted more new weekly unemployment claims than in the entirety of the Great Recession and the highest net job losses since 2009 as well means U.S. consumers aren't looking to spend $1,000 on the latest new iPhone or iPad, and a few hundred more on AirPods, but rather just trying to refocus on paying rent or putting food on the table.\\n\\nThe original 4GB iPhone cost $499 in 2007, about $622 in 2020 dollars. Now Apple's new iPhones regularly and easily reach into the $1,000 or more range and not including accessories such as AirPods and wireless chargers which can easily add more costs and are far more expensive than their counterparts of years past.\\n\\nWhile in the midst of the Great Recession Apple did post substantial gains in product sales and net revenue nonetheless it seemed at the time to be primarily a function of increasing market share to smartphone competitors and back when an iPhone was comparatively cheaper than what we are used to in recent years for Apple. With Apple nowadays the far-and-away leader in U.S. smartphone market share it does not seem likely that can be repeated as a way for Apple to continue to post growth during a downturn. Apple is already seemingly considering delaying its iPhone 12, its high-touted 5G model with estimated price ranges of between $700 and $1000 for various permutations, with reports saying it seemingly is due to worries over the economic and consumer environment of the upcoming half-year and the dent that may have on the release's potential.\\n\\nIt is likely that by this time near things will have returned largely back to normal in terms of the consumer and macro environment, and Apple has ample cash to weather this crisis as it had over $163 billion in current assets as of the end of 2019, but the above all foment a difficult environment for Apple and of uncertain duration in the meantime. At the onset of the coronavirus pandemic Apple guided that they were facing significant supply chain disruptions within China as well as severe disruptions to demand. While that situation currently appears largely reversed within China the rest of the world is experiencing that on a scale seemingly more widespread and of greater duration.\\n\\nOn the positive side companies that are services-oriented are generally seeing boosts in usage, a major driver behind Microsoft's revenue and stock price cushioning amid this pandemic, and Apple's increasingly-important services revenue is no exception. While Apple faces risks to its services revenue due to it largely being consumer-facing and the above-described hit to consumer spending may similarly reduce people's willingness to spend on mobile games, dating apps, fitness trackers, and the like, nonetheless the usage boost from people being confined to home means services revenue is likely to be cushioned more than hardware sales.\\n\\nIn this kind of economic and consumer environment it is very likely Apple sales will see a massive hit for the next 1-3 quarters as its core product lines face a seemingly insurmountable hurdle and its primary geographic focuses are the regions most deeply affected by the coronavirus pandemic and associated shutdowns. If the economic health of consumers continues to nosedive we may see this create deep worries too for Apple product spending as consumers refocus on necessities over discretionary and given Apple's far higher price points for its products than in the Great Recession.\\n\\nOn the positive end Apple is flush with cash and liquidity, its growing services revenue component may not be as badly hit, its China segment is seemingly rapidly rebounding, and the stock price has already collapsed immensely since the pandemic began. At $267 and a P/E ratio of 21 it is not hard to imagine Apple stock will falling somewhat further in-line with times, not even in downturns, where it has not had rich and optimistic mega-growth expectations built into its price as before the pandemic began.\",\n",

       "    'body': 'Save for a few minor changes such as larger screens, different materials and various watch band designs, the look of the watch hasn\\'t changed much since Apple introduced the first Apple Watch in 2014. And this year will be no different.\\n\\nRumors of a circular watch face on the Apple Watch have been making the rounds for a few years now. Some of its Android counterparts like the Samsung Galaxy Watch have circular designs, so it wouldn\\'t be too much of a stretch to think Apple would follow suit. To add fuel to the fire, the company has also issued a couple Apple Watch patents that show a round display. But so far, it\\'s just a possibility; the existence of a patent doesn\\'t guarantee Apple will use it in a product. Even if one of these patents does become a reality, it would likely take years. A change this big would require Apple to rework the hardware and software of the watch, and so far we haven\\'t heard anything that would indicate it\\'s happening in 2020.\\n\\nThe Apple Watch has tons of customizable watch faces (known as \"complications\") ranging from animated Disney characters to weather-centric interfaces. But Apple still hasn\\'t loosened the reins for third-party watch faces, and we don\\'t see that changing anytime soon.\\n\\nInstead Apple might allow users to share watch faces. According to a 9to5Mac, each watch face configuration will be shared as a unique file via AirDrop. The report, which cites leaked iOS 14 code as the source of its information, also says WatchOS 7, the next version of Apple\\'s smartwatch software, will add an analog-style tachymeter to its design options that would measure speed and distance.\\n\\nYou may also be able to use shared albums from your photos app to create a customized watch face that cycles through the photos in that album. That means family members could add individual photos to the shared album for everyone in the group to see on their wrists.\\n\\nLastly, for patriotic users, WatchOS 7 may add an \"international\" option that lets you choose a country\\'s flag as your watch face.\\n\\nFitness has been at the core of the Apple Watch since its launch, and this year Apple may take it even further. According to MacRumors, the company is working on a standalone fitness app. Unlike the existing Activity app that tracks your progress and is already on the Apple Watch (and iPhone), this one would give you guided workouts for an assortment of different activities such as running, cycling, rowing, strength training, dance and yoga.\\n\\nThere\\'s no shortage of third-party fitness apps like this for the Apple Watch, but a native fitness app could put a lot of those out of business. The app would be available on the iPhone and Apple TV as well as the Apple Watch. And it might be free. The MacRumors report says there\\'s no evidence of in-app purchases, but that doesn\\'t necessarily rule out a subscription based approach like Apple Music.\\n\\nThis could finally be the year when Apple Watch gets native sleep tracking. Since acquiring the sleep sensor Beddit back in 2017, a tracker that sits under the mattress, there have been rumors about Apple integrating a similar feature in the Apple Watch. A \"Sleep app\" was also accidentally mentioned in a screenshot of Apple\\'s preinstalled Alarm app in the App Store. The image was spotted by a reader of MacRumos back in October, and has since been removed.\\n\\nCurrently, sleep tracking is available on the Apple Watch through third-party apps and one of the biggest hurdles for Apple to offer it natively has been battery life. The current Apple Watch models last about a day and a half of normal use, but a feature like this would require overnight monitoring. This would likely drain the battery much faster. It\\'s in the company\\'s best interest to solve this issue soon though; many Apple Watch competitors like Fitbit and Samsung have had it on their devices for years.\\n\\nEven if the Series 6 doesn\\'t have native sleep tracking, Apple will likely continue expanding health and wellness features for the next Apple Watch.\\n\\nThis year\\'s big health feature could be what\\'s known as SPO2 tracking. This would allow the watch to measure your blood oxygen levels and alert you if it dips below a certain threshold, according to 9to5Mac. The Apple Watch already does something similar with heart rate, and alerts you if it detects an abnormally high, low or irregular heart rhythm indicative of atrial fibrillation (afib).\\n\\nFor this to be possible, the Series 6 could require a new type of sensor, likely a pulse oximeter. Or it might be able to pull with a software update and use the existing hardware. The Apple Watch already tracks VO2 max (or maximum oxygen consumption) inside the Activity app using the GPS and heart rate sensor during exercise.\\n\\nOther health rumors include glucose and blood-pressure monitoring on the next Apple Watch, but these could be further off.\\n\\nThe leaked iOS 14 code reportedly also references new tools for parents. Rather than give their kids an iPhone, parents looking to stay connected with their kids, could set up a second Apple Watch (completely separate from theirs) using their iPhone and Apple ID as the host. This would also give parents the final say on what kind of content their kids can access on the watch like emergency contacts and music.\\n\\nWith a feature called SchoolTime in WatchOS 7, parents could even determine what apps can be used at what times to limit distractions in the classroom.\\n\\nThis would also mean adapting some of the health features for younger users. According to 9 to 5 Mac, the ring system (used for activity tracking) would be based on different metrics. The red move ring, for example, would track active minutes instead of active calories as it does with adults. The Watch will also incentivise kids to keep moving by offering virtual rewards when they take part in sports or outdoor activities.',\n",

       "    'title': \"Apple's Dark Sky acquisition is the latest move in the company's master plan to grow its biggest product other than the iPhone\",\n",
       "    'body': \"It could also add more fuel to the argument that Apple makes it difficult for smaller app makers to compete against Apple's own services.\\n\\nApple just acquired the popular weather app Dark Sky, a move that gives the iPhone maker another avenue to expand its ever-growing services division. That category has become increasingly important for the Apple as it seeks to become less reliant on smartphone sales.\\n\\nDark Sky announced the acquisition in a blog post on Monday, although the terms of the deal have not been disclosed. The iOS app will remain unchanged, but those using Dark Sky on Android or Google's Wear OS smartwatch platform will only have access to the app until July 1. The company will also continue to support its application programming interface - a set of tools and protocols that allows other developers to integrate Dark Sky data into their own weather apps - for existing customers through the end of 2021.\\n\\nApple's decision to purchase Dark Sky makes sense when you look at the company's direction in recent years. The firm gradually has been building its services division and shifting the focus to its software offerings, particularly while iPhone sales have declined as consumers have been upgrading their devices less frequently.\\n\\nRoughly a year ago, for example, it held an entire special event dedicated to new digital offerings like Apple TV Plus, Apple Arcade, and Apple News Plus, a rare move for a company that usually only holds press conferences to announce new hardware.\\n\\nApple's services division, which encompasses App Store purchases as well as subscriptions like Apple Arcade, iCloud, and Apple Care, now accounts for more quarterly revenue than the iPad and the Mac. In fact, it generates more quarterly revenue than any Apple product other than the iPhone.\\n\\nIn Apple's fiscal first quarter of 2020, services generated $12.7 billion in revenue, while the Mac division generated $7.1 billion and the iPad was responsible for $5.9 billion. When Apple's iPhone revenue saw several consecutive quarterly declines over the course of 2018 and 2019, Apple's services and wearables divisions were a bright spot.\\n\\nNow, with the acquisition of Dark Sky (which costs $3.99 in Apple's App Store) the company has yet another possible revenue stream to add to its burgeoning services division.\\n\\nIt's unclear precisely what Apple plans to do with Dark Sky, but there are plenty of possibilities. Apple already has premium apps - either developed in-house or through acquisitions - for many popular app categories. These include music (Apple Music), news (Apple News Plus), streaming entertainment (Apple TV Plus), personal finance (Apple Card), and gaming (Apple Arcade).\\n\\nAdding weather to the portfolio seems like a sensible addition, especially considering Apple is rumored to be working on a bundled offering that would include multiple services for the one price. A subscription that provides a premium weather app along with the news, for instance, seems like a natural pairing.\\n\\nThere's also the possibility that Apple could use data from Dark Sky simply to bolster its existing core iPhone apps, like the weather app and Siri. Apple's stock apps have been the focus of its major iPhone updates in recent years, so it's plausible to think that Apple could use Dark Sky as part of planned improvements to the weather app in iOS 14 and beyond. Last year's iOS 13 update brought major upgrades to other Apple apps like Health, Reminders, and Photos.\\n\\nRegardless of Apple's plans, the acquisition likely won't bode well for its reputation as it relates to concerns over potentially anticompetitive business practices. Over the last year, large firms like Apple, Google, Amazon, and Facebook have come under scrutiny from lawmakers who have argued that the size and influence of these tech giants hampers competition.\\n\\nApple has been in the spotlight because it runs the iPhone's App Store while also offering its own services that compete directly with those found in the store. Buying Dark Sky has given Apple another asset in competing with third-party apps, an addition that probably won't assuage recent antitrust woes.\\n\\nLast year was a milestone era for Apple services, and if the Dark Sky acquisition reveals anything, it's that Apple isn't slowing down anytime soon.\",\n",

When Apple's iPhone revenue saw several consecutive quarterly declines over the course of 2018 and 2019, Apple's services and wearables divisions were a bright spot.\\n\\nNow, with the acquisition of Dark Sky (which costs $3.99 in Apple's App Store) the company has yet another possible revenue stream to add to its burgeoning services division.\\n\\nIt's unclear precisely what Apple plans to do with Dark Sky, but there are plenty of possibilities. Apple already has premium apps - either developed in-house or through acquisitions - for many popular app categories. These include music (Apple Music), news (Apple News Plus), streaming entertainment (Apple TV Plus), personal finance (Apple Card), and gaming (Apple Arcade).\\n\\nAdding weather to the portfolio seems like a sensible addition, especially considering Apple is rumored to be working on a bundled offering that would include multiple services for the one price. A subscription that provides a premium weather app along with the news, for instance, seems like a natural pairing.\\n\\nThere's also the possibility that Apple could use data from Dark Sky simply to bolster its existing core iPhone apps, like the weather app and Siri. Apple's stock apps have been the focus of its major iPhone updates in recent years, so it's plausible to think that Apple could use Dark Sky as part of planned improvements to the weather app in iOS 14 and beyond. Last year's iOS 13 update brought major upgrades to other Apple apps like Health, Reminders, and Photos.\\n\\nRegardless of Apple's plans, the acquisition likely won't bode well for its reputation as it relates to concerns over potentially anticompetitive business practices. Over the last year, large firms like Apple, Google, Amazon, and Facebook have come under scrutiny from lawmakers who have argued that the size and influence of these tech giants hampers competition.\\n\\nApple has been in the spotlight because it runs the iPhone's App Store while also offering its own services that compete directly with those found in the store. Buying Dark Sky has given Apple another asset in competing with third-party apps, an addition that probably won't assuage recent antitrust woes.\\n\\nLast year was a milestone era for Apple services, and if the Dark Sky acquisition reveals anything, it's that Apple isn't slowing down anytime soon.\",\n",

       "    'title': \"COVID-19 May Increase Apple's Asia Focus Even As India Faces Potential Meltdown\",\n",
       "    'body': 'Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has had a series of false dawns in India. My article in November gave details of promising developments for the company there at that time.\\n\\nIt appeared that the pieces of the jigsaw were finally falling into place for the ever-patient Tim Cook. COVID-19 looks like putting everything on hold in India, perhaps for a very long time. This will have a limited impact on Apple\\'s revenue targets but more on its manufacturing operations.\\n\\nI first wrote about how important China would become to Apple revenues in January 2015. Then, many subscribers made critical comments saying Apple sales would never take off in such a poor country. They were, of course, wrong. Greater China produces huge revenues for the company, as does the \"Rest of Asia\" category. The company would like India to play a similar driving role in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic will delay that aim.\\n\\nIt is ironic that recently Apple had been criticised for being too dependent upon China. Now, China is looking a better bet than most other countries in a post COVID-19 world. It is no coincidence that China is the only country where Apple\\'s retail stores are operating. Apple may refocus its manufacturing attention on China and other countries in Asia such as Vietnam and Taiwan.\\n\\nThe government has slashed interest rates and taken measures to boost liquidity following the lockdown of its 1.3 billion people. The economy has not contracted for two decades. It had, though, slowed somewhat in Q4 2019, falling to a 4.7% growth rate. Collapsing oil prices will help the economy somewhat. The nationwide shutdown will ensure a contraction in the economy, which could be very severe.\\n\\nA logistics executive based in Asia told me that his company\\'s approximate 250 logistics centres around the country were currently shut down, and food and medicines could not move. Huge numbers of poor people, often working far away from home, are stranded. All State borders are closed.\\n\\nIndia is still basically a poor country where masses of people live in very close proximity to each other. Migrant and daily wage workers now have nowhere to go and no income. Scenes last week at the Delhi bus station show workers massing together to get somewhere to avoid the virus but probably just catching it:\\n\\nThe Guardian\\n\\nThe terrible effects such scenes will have on workers and the economy are clear for all to see. One religious preacher who refused to self-isolate despite having the disease has single-handedly led to the quarantining of 40,000 people. The government has thankfully since banned religious gatherings, though it is uncertain if such a ban can be enforced.\\n\\nIt is hard to imagine that contact tracing, testing and hospital treatment for COVID 19 patients are viable except for a very few rich people. India averages 8 doctors and 7 hospital beds per 10,000 people. The country has a maximum of 40,000 ventilators for their population of over 1.3 billion people.\\n\\nSocial and economic catastrophe is likely to result. Apple\\'s expansion plans will be on lockdown along with the population.\\n\\nMy article in February gave details of how Apple\\'s sales were finally looking promising in India. It was estimated that iPhone sales had increased 200% in Q4 2019 year on year. A survey by Counterpoint concluded that the iPhone was the fastest growing premium smartphone in the country in 2019. Comments by Apple executives at the analyst call had been unusually bullish. Xiaomi (OTCPK:XIACF), OnePlus, and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) remain the best-selling premium brands in the country.\\n\\nAs my article explained, for an international company setting up retail stores in India is a very complex business. The company seemed to have finally cracked it at the time Tim Cook reported in the shareholder letter in late February. He made it clear the company preferred to handle its own retail operations. It expected to open its first retail store, in Mumbai, in 2021. This would be followed by a second in Delhi. The company\\'s main distribution centre is in Mumbai, run by a 3rd party partner.\\n\\nThey also expected to start online sales this year, although the timeline had been brought back to later in the year. Currently, it is estimated that 30% of Apple sales in the country are online through portals such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Flipkart. The right to open bricks and mortar stores is tied up with the requirement that 30% of the product must be local content. Thus, the manufacturing and retail operations are inextricably bound. Now, both sides of the operation look to be in trouble in the short to medium term.\\n\\nThe short-term effect on Apple\\'s sales revenues will be tiny compared to total sales revenue. It is, however, the current cessation of any short-term revenue growth.\\n\\nAs my article here detailed, Apple has been manufacturing in India through its contract partners. Wistron (OTC:WICOF) has been making the iPhone SE and 6S for the local market at its Bengaluru factory. Foxconn (OTC:FXCOF) has been making the XR at its factory in Chennai. Foxconn has reportedly been investing huge sums in its Indian facilities.\\n\\nApple had been reported as planning to build its new lower cost phone, variously known as the \"SE2\" or \"iPhone 9\" in India. They had earmarked US$1 billion for future manufacturing in the country. Recent reports, however, indicate that the SE2 is in fact being built at a purpose-built facility in Zhengfu for the international market. It may still be that the SE2 will in time be produced in India for the Indian market.\\n\\nAt best, Apple\\'s proposed US$1 billion will now be substantially delayed. The initial lockdown period for the Wistron and Foxconn factories is from 25th March to 14th April. It seems certain that will be prolonged substantially.\\n\\nPerhaps, India needs Apple more than Apple needs India. The authorities in India would do well to replicate the kind of support China gave Apple in the past. For one Apple/Foxconn factory (paywalled) in Henan province, the local authorities invested US$1.5 billion to assist in building factories and housing, plus US$10 billion for a new airport.\\n\\nTim Cook first met with PM Modi in 2016, but it seems some issues remain unresolved. As my February article detailed, it seems quite large quantities of iPhones manufactured in India are being exported. Presumably, that volume will now be on hold for some time. However, the two sides are still trying to resolve issues of getting zero import duties for components in phones which are made and exported from India.\\n\\nIndia currently has many disadvantages as a manufacturing base compared to China. These might be summarised as:\\n\\n* Shortage of skilled labour.\\n\\n* Shortage of efficient manufacturers with engineering expertise.\\n\\n* Poor internal logistics and transport links.\\n\\n* Difficulty in getting Indian companies to comply with responsibility policies of the company.\\n\\nReports suggest that Apple had considered building the new iPhone 11 in India, but decided against the idea because of the constraints listed above.\\n\\nPresident Trump\\'s call last year for Apple to relocate its manufacturing to the USA was not taken seriously by anyone who understands modern supply chains. The USA does not have the right skilled labour, the supplier network, the efficient distribution network, the cost base, or the network of companies to produce Apple\\'s products.\\n\\nThe trade war with China last year did, however, lead many companies to consider widening the geographical base of their supply chain around different Asian countries. COVID19 will give this idea renewed momentum.\\n\\nApple\\'s component suppliers are already taking steps. Taiwan-based Wistron had stated they are putting more investment into India and Vietnam. Fellow Taiwanese company Pegatron had stated they are putting in more manufacturing capacity in Taiwan itself, in India, in Vietnam, and in Indonesia. Meiloon Industrial is putting in more capacity in Taiwan and Indonesia. Foxconn, Apple\\'s biggest partner in iPhone production, stated last year that they were investing NT$17 billion (US$561 million) in new factories in India and Vietnam. What will happen to all these plans as they relate specifically to India remains to be seen.\\n\\nApple itself has been investing in a smartphone screen factory in Japan, although with a few problems. Taiwan may make particular headway in manufacturing share due to that country\\'s successful containment (so far) of COVID-19. As of 30th March, Taiwan had had only 306 cases in the country despite being at its Asian epicentre for the past 3 months.\\n\\nThe worldwide recession will, of course, cut demand for iPhones this year. Analysts in Taiwan have reckoned that iPhone shipments in 2020 will fall from an anticipated 204 million to 198 million. That seems quite optimistic to me.\\n\\nWhether or not a 5G iPhone will now be launched in the autumn is open to doubt. That is both for demand reasons and also because of doubts whether supply chains around Asia will hold up. Further problems are caused by the inability of top Apple engineering and design executives to travel. Any delay would, though, be a substantial sales revenue hit for Apple in China, where Huawei will be a towering competitor on 5G.\\n\\nApple\\'s sales in China had already been hit by Trump\\'s protectionist measures last year and now COVID-19 this year. The illustration from \"The Economist\" below shows how China is a choppy market:\\n\\nThe \"Rest of Asia\" category has been growing revenues strongly. Japan remains the country with the greatest concentration of Apple products of any country in the world. Asia, with its 5 billion people, will continue to grow in importance for the company\\'s revenues in the short term and the long term. China will once again be at the centre of this.\\n\\nMy article in November 2018 can be referenced for the macroeconomic opportunities Asia represents for Apple. These can be summarised as:\\n\\n* A growing youthful population.\\n\\n* Stronger economic growth than any other part of the world.\\n\\n* Sheer numbers as the most populous continent in the world.\\n\\nDespite the problems Apple faces from COVID-19, long term, the pandemic will probably benefit the company. With its strong balance sheet and cash hoard, it will not fall by the wayside. Many of its competitors may get culled. The company is likely to continue refocusing its supply chain to become less dependent upon single countries. The statutory and health problems from India will lead to India temporarily going down the scale in importance. Long term, though, the second largest country in the world cannot be kept on the back burner.\\n\\nCompanies like Apple will also probably face less regulatory scrutiny for a while as governments look to them to drag economies out of recession or depression.\\n\\nAsia represents 30% of the company\\'s revenues and almost all of its manufacturing capacity. COVID-19 will probably speed up this process as certain Asian countries get back online more rapidly than their Western counterparts.\\n\\nChina will probably become more welcoming again to Apple as a tool to get their economy back up and running. It should increase in importance again for the company. The COVID-19 crisis makes it unlikely India will be in a position to do likewise.',\n",

       "    'body': \"It could also add more fuel to the argument that Apple makes it difficult for smaller app makers to compete against Apple's own services.\\n\\nApple just acquired the popular weather app Dark Sky, a move that gives the iPhone maker another avenue to expand its ever-growing services division.

       "    'body': \"Apple will kill off the Android version of the Dark Sky weather predicting app after purchasing the company for an undisclosed amount.\\n\\nWhile there will be no change to the iOS version of the app, the Android version is no longer available to download and will be shutting down on July 1.\\n\\nDark Sky for Android has already been stripped from the Google Play Store to prevent new downloads.\\n\\nThe decision to put an end to the Android version could be seen as a wily move by Apple to attempt to force fans of the popular app to move to iOS.\\n\\nDark Sky provides 'hyperlocal' weather forecasts by location, including minute-by-minute predictions, and smartphone alerts.\\n\\nFrom left, the Dark Sky app - now only for iOS - provides users with hour-by-hour temperature readings, visualisations of weather activity and smartphone alerts\\n\\nVersions of the app for wearables - both Wear iOS and non-Apple devices - will also be ended.\\n\\nDark Sky's co-founder announced the purchase in a blog post, saying that the deal will allow the service to 'reach more people'.\\n\\n'Today we have some important and exciting news to share - Dark Sky has joined Apple,' said Dark Sky co-founder Adam Grossman in a blog post.\\n\\nDark Sky (logo above) describes its service as the most accurate source of 'hyperlocal' weather information\\n\\n'Our goal has always been to provide the world with the best weather information possible, to help as many people as we can stay dry and safe, and to do so in a way that respects your privacy.\\n\\n'There is no better place to accomplish these goals than at Apple.'\\n\\nGrossman said there will be no changes to Dark Sky for iOS at the moment, which will continue to be available for purchase in the App Store at £3.99.\\n\\nAndroid subscribers who still have still active subscription at the time it is shut down on July 1 will receive a refund.\\n\\nThe reaction to the takeover - and the decision to drop the Android version of the app - was predominantly negative on Twitter.\\n\\nThe reactions of Twitter users to the acquisition and the decision to end Dark Sky for Android was most negative\\n\\n'Wow.

I need a new weather app. F*** Apple. #exclusivity.'\\n\\nMany Android users appeared to be slightly put out by the news that their favourite weather app wouldn't be supported in just a few months\\n\\nIn his blog post, Grossman also said that Dark Sky's application programming interface (API) software, which is used by other weather apps, will be available until 2021, but it will no longer allow new sign-ups.\\n\\nOverdrop Weather, another weather-predicting app, said the takeover means its app will continue to function on Dark Sky API until the end of next year - if it doesn't decide to remove it before that date.\\n\\nDark Sky says its 'homegrown weather service' lets users look up the weather anywhere globally.\\n\\nIt provides detailed forecasts for a particular location broken day by hour of the day, as well as animated maps that show oncoming weather events like storms.\\n\\nIt also sends out alerts to stay up to date 'without having to check the app'.\\n\\nDark Sky's website also provides a world map with real-time weather updates including temperature\\n\\n'With down-to-the-minute forecasts, you'll know exactly when the rain will start or stop, right where you're standing. It's almost like magic,' it says on its site.\\n\\nDark Sky's website also provides a world map with real-time updates on temperature, cloud cover, wind speed and even ozone readings.\\n\\nGrossman said the purchase makes Dark Sky subject to the Apple Privacy Policy.\\n\\nThe privacy page on the Dark Sky website also redirects to Apple's privacy policy, which says it 'may provide third parties with certain personal information to provide or improve our products and services'.\\n\\nApple bought the music-identifying app Shazam just over 18 months ago - however, the Android version was kept alive.\\n\\nThe UK-based app lets users identify songs by pointing their smartphone.\\n\\nTHE TRILLION DOLLAR RISE OF APPLE\\n\\nThe company's journey to the summit of the technology industry has been a rocky one, having seen Jobs (pictured right in 1976) leave the firm in the mid-1980s after his pet project, the first Macintosh computer, struggled and he attempted to oust then chief executive John Sculley. Wozniak is pictured left\\n\\n1976: Founders Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne created the company on April 1 1976 as they set about selling computer kits to hobbyists, each of which was built by Wozniak.\\n\\nThe first product was the Apple I.\\n\\n1977: Apple released the Apple II in June, which was the first PC made for the mass market.\\n\\n1981: Jobs became chairman.\\n\\n1984: The Macintosh was introduced during an ad break for the Super Bowl and later officially unveiled during a launch event.

       "    'body': 'Save for a few minor changes such as larger screens, different materials and various watch band designs, the look of the watch hasn\\'t changed much since Apple introduced the first Apple Watch in 2014. And this year will be no different.\\n\\nRumors of a circular watch face on the Apple Watch have been making the rounds for a few years now. Some of its Android counterparts like the Samsung Galaxy Watch have circular designs, so it wouldn\\'t be too much of a stretch to think Apple would follow suit. To add fuel to the fire, the company has also issued a couple Apple Watch patents that show a round display. But so far, it\\'s just a possibility; the existence of a patent doesn\\'t guarantee Apple will use it in a product. Even if one of these patents does become a reality, it would likely take years. A change this big would require Apple to rework the hardware and software of the watch, and so far we haven\\'t heard anything that would indicate it\\'s happening in 2020.\\n\\nThe Apple Watch has tons of customizable watch faces (known as \"complications\") ranging from animated Disney characters to weather-centric interfaces. But Apple still hasn\\'t loosened the reins for third-party watch faces, and we don\\'t see that changing anytime soon.\\n\\nInstead Apple might allow users to share watch faces. According to a 9to5Mac, each watch face configuration will be shared as a unique file via AirDrop. The report, which cites leaked iOS 14 code as the source of its information, also says WatchOS 7, the next version of Apple\\'s smartwatch software, will add an analog-style tachymeter to its design options that would measure speed and distance.\\n\\nYou may also be able to use shared albums from your photos app to create a customized watch face that cycles through the photos in that album. That means family members could add individual photos to the shared album for everyone in the group to see on their wrists.\\n\\nLastly, for patriotic users, WatchOS 7 may add an \"international\" option that lets you choose a country\\'s flag as your watch face.\\n\\nFitness has been at the core of the Apple Watch since its launch, and this year Apple may take it even further. According to MacRumors, the company is working on a standalone fitness app. Unlike the existing Activity app that tracks your progress and is already on the Apple Watch (and iPhone), this one would give you guided workouts for an assortment of different activities such as running, cycling, rowing, strength training, dance and yoga.\\n\\nThere\\'s no shortage of third-party fitness apps like this for the Apple Watch, but a native fitness app could put a lot of those out of business. The app would be available on the iPhone and Apple TV as well as the Apple Watch. And it might be free. The MacRumors report says there\\'s no evidence of in-app purchases, but that doesn\\'t necessarily rule out a subscription based approach like Apple Music.\\n\\nThis could finally be the year when Apple Watch gets native sleep tracking. Since acquiring the sleep sensor Beddit back in 2017, a tracker that sits under the mattress, there have been rumors about Apple integrating a similar feature in the Apple Watch. A \"Sleep app\" was also accidentally mentioned in a screenshot of Apple\\'s preinstalled Alarm app in the App Store. The image was spotted by a reader of MacRumos back in October, and has since been removed.\\n\\nCurrently, sleep tracking is available on the Apple Watch through third-party apps and one of the biggest hurdles for Apple to offer it natively has been battery life. The current Apple Watch models last about a day and a half of normal use, but a feature like this would require overnight monitoring. This would likely drain the battery much faster. It\\'s in the company\\'s best interest to solve this issue soon though; many Apple Watch competitors like Fitbit and Samsung have had it on their devices for years.\\n\\nEven if the Series 6 doesn\\'t have native sleep tracking, Apple will likely continue expanding health and wellness features for the next Apple Watch.\\n\\nThis year\\'s big health feature could be what\\'s known as SPO2 tracking. This would allow the watch to measure your blood oxygen levels and alert you if it dips below a certain threshold, according to 9to5Mac. The Apple Watch already does something similar with heart rate, and alerts you if it detects an abnormally high, low or irregular heart rhythm indicative of atrial fibrillation (afib).\\n\\nFor this to be possible, the Series 6 could require a new type of sensor, likely a pulse oximeter. Or it might be able to pull with a software update and use the existing hardware. The Apple Watch already tracks VO2 max (or maximum oxygen consumption) inside the Activity app using the GPS and heart rate sensor during exercise.\\n\\nOther health rumors include glucose and blood-pressure monitoring on the next Apple Watch, but these could be further off.\\n\\nThe leaked iOS 14 code reportedly also references new tools for parents. Rather than give their kids an iPhone, parents looking to stay connected with their kids, could set up a second Apple Watch (completely separate from theirs) using their iPhone and Apple ID as the host. This would also give parents the final say on what kind of content their kids can access on the watch like emergency contacts and music.\\n\\nWith a feature called SchoolTime in WatchOS 7, parents could even determine what apps can be used at what times to limit distractions in the classroom.\\n\\nThis would also mean adapting some of the health features for younger users. According to 9 to 5 Mac, the ring system (used for activity tracking) would be based on different metrics. The red move ring, for example, would track active minutes instead of active calories as it does with adults. The Watch will also incentivise kids to keep moving by offering virtual rewards when they take part in sports or outdoor activities.',\n",

       "    'body': \"You can still buy Apple gear when you're on a budget, but you need to make more careful choices -- and also know exactly where to look.\\n\\nWe've talked before about how best to buy Apple gear when you have a budget of $1,000, but plenty of us will often have less. Or regardless of our financial situation, we may have greater need to spend that money elsewhere, yet we still need a good computing device.\\n\\nFor under $500, you can buy a new iPad, or a refurbished Mac. Making this or any choice will always start with what you need the device to do, but thereafter it's a tradeoff. You're deciding between portability and performance, for instance, and you've got to think about the software that you'll need to run.\\n\\nOnce you've figured out your needs, you need to look at the figures -- and you're best off starting with a decision between an iPad device and a Mac. Some people might scoff at the concept of choosing an iPad over a MacBook, but plenty of people have found that an iPad can do everything they need it to and slots into their lives much better than a traditional computer.\\n\\nIf you've owned an iPhone for a while, chances are you own plenty of apps that will transfer over to iPadOS, which is one of the best things about the Apple ecosystem. And these days, plenty of developers are creating iPad compatible versions of their desktop software. In essence, Microsoft has recently done this with Microsoft Office, and Adobe is porting some of their most popular programs to iPadOS, too.\\n\\nLet's not forget just how much effort Apple has put into bridging the gap between computers and tablets as well. The iPad is compatible with Bluetooth keyboards, and the Apple Pencil can be connected to a monitor via an adapter and is capable of supporting a mouse.\\n\\nYour cheapest option for a brand new iPad is the seventh-generation, 10.2-inch iPad. This is an excellent option as an eReader and simple internet browser, though it does eschew some of the bells and whistles of the more expensive models.\\n\\nThe basic iPad model includes Touch ID with Apple Pay functionality. The iPad's 8-megapixel rear camera can shoot in 1080p HD video, a 1.2-megapixel FaceTime HD camera, and a battery with a lifespan of about 10 hours. Its 10.2-inch screen does have Retina display but does not feature True Tone adaptive technology. It also supports the first-generation Apple Pencil.\\n\\nPricing for the 10.2-inch iPad starts at $329 for the no-frills version, but you'll get a bit of wiggle room to customize-- or maybe for accessories.\\n\\nFor storage options, you can pick either 32GB or 128GB. The 32GB is significantly cheaper at $329 but assumes you won't be storing much in the way of pictures, music, video, or apps on the device itself. This is an excellent choice for those who are planning on streaming most of their content through services like YouTube or Apple Music, but likely won't be enough for those who want to play games.\\n\\nThe 128GB is $429 but offers plenty of storage for games and media. If you're feeling unsure about which you should buy, we suggest bumping up to the 128GB one, as it's always better to have extra storage rather than not enough.\\n\\nIf you do pick the 32GB iPad, you can add on cellular connectivity for an additional $130, bringing the price to $459. If you're a frequent traveler, or if you've cut ties with a traditional cable provider in favor of getting your internet from your mobile service provider, this is a great option. However, not everyone needs it.\\n\\nUnfortunately, if you choose the 128GB iPad, adding in cellular service will break the budget, bringing the total cost to $559.\\n\\nInitially released in November of 2012, Apple's diminutive 7.9-inch iPad mini has undergone substantial changes since its inception. Designed to go wherever you go, Apple's smallest tablet is great for cozying up with a book, jotting down notes, catching up on your favorite shows, and more.\\n\\nIt features a 7.9-inch screen, placing it securely in the phablet territory. The display features P3 wide-color display, True Tone technology, and supports the first-generation Apple Pencil.\\n\\nThis model also has Touch ID with Apple Pay functionality. The 8-megapixel rear camera can shoot in 1080p HD video, a 1.2-megapixel FaceTime HD camera, and a battery with a lifespan of about 10 hours.\\n\\nThe iPad mini is a bit more expensive than its slightly larger sibling -- the iPad -- which means that if you want to stay within your budget, you'll have to stick to the 64GB model, which costs $399. You can tack on cellular connectivity if you need to travel with it, but that will raise the price to $529.\\n\\nThe iPad Air 3 is exceptional for anyone who is looking for a larger iPad. Still, its higher price point will put you right at your $500 budget without any additional ability to customize.\\n\\nAvailable in space gray, silver, and gold, the iPad Air features a 10.5-inch Retina display screen with True Tone support. It's incredibly light -- only one pound -- making it the perfect companion to travel with.\\n\\nThis model also has Touch ID with Apple Pay functionality, an 8-megapixel rear camera that can shoot in 1080p HD video, a 1.2-megapixel FaceTime HD camera, and a battery with a lifespan of about 10 hours.\\n\\nThe base Wi-Fi only model comes with 64GB of storage for $499, with any further customizations, like additional storage space or cellular connectivity, boosting the price to over $600. If you haven't broken your budget, or you're willing to spend a little bit extra, we highly suggest taking a look at what accessories Apple has created to help unlock the full potential of your iPad. The Apple Pencil was introduced alongside the 2015 iPad Pro, and since has grown into a powerhouse in its own right. The first-generation Apple Pencil is supported on all current iPad models and can be used for a wide variety of features.\\n\\nThe Apple Pencil is fully pressure- and tilt-sensitive, making it a must-have for artists of all skill levels. Additionally, users can utilize it for jotting down quick notes, lists, and ideas the same way they would jot them down on paper.\\n\\nThe first-generation Apple Pencil can be purchased for $99. Remember, though, the iPads listed above are only compatible with the first-generation Apple Pencil as the second generation is exclusively used for the more recently released lines of iPad Pro. One of the best things you can do to make your iPad more natural to use is to pair it with a keyboard, and Apple's Smart Keyboard Folios are some of the best. The keyboard is a joy to type on, and when it's not in use, it folds over to create a slim, lightweight cover.\\n\\nThe Smart Keyboard Folio is available for the seventh-generation iPad and the third-generation iPad Air and retails for $159. The cheapest Mac that Apple sells new is the recently updated Mac mini, and while it's still $799, that figure is now a much better buy. Previously it got you 128GB SSD storage and that's simply not usable so you had to pay more -- if you even knew just how difficult it is to manage on such a small drive.\\n\\nApple won't go below that $799 with anything new, but if your $500 budget is a little flexible, you can sometimes get close to it through Apple's refurb store. This is Apple's official store for selling Macs as-new, that is ones that have been bought and returned for some reason.\\n\\nIf you can find the Mac you want there, get it. The machines have always been refurbished to be exactly as new, and they are invariably sold at a much reduced price. It's just that the refurb store depends on what machines have been bought and returned, so you get little and sometimes no choice. The refurb store also offers no build to order option, you can't specify particular configurations, and actually you do need to. Even when you are buying secondhand or through other resellers than Apple, there are minimum requirements if you're to get use out of your new Mac.\\n\\nThere are really two considerations. The first is storage space. If the machine you're looking at comes with SSD instead of a hard drive, don't get anything less than 256GB of it. If it does have a hard drive, you can practically ignore size limits because hard drives are so much cheaper that you'd have to work hard to get a Mac that didn't have an adequate one.\\n\\nThen there's RAM. The minimum amount of RAM to go for in any Mac is 8GB. That will be enough that you can usefully do work on the Mac now, and that it will last you for a decent amount of time.\\n\\nWith both RAM and SSD storage, though, the more you can get, the substantially better.\\n\\nThere is also one more consideration, which is whether to go for a desktop Mac or a notebook one. Ultimately the decision is down to what you need to do with the Mac, what's available, and what you can afford. However, there is one truism. A desktop Mac will always cost less than any kind of MacBook.\\n\\nIf you're comparing similar models and similar years of release, the desktop Mac will always be more powerful than the MacBook, too. It's because the desktop Macs don't have to have specialized or just plain smaller components to fit their casing.\\n\\nSo purely on the basis of what you get for your money, a desktop Mac is going to be the best value -- until you need to move around with it. Unlike Apple, other resellers will let you configure Macs to what you need, which means that as well as a cheaper price, you really can be getting a bargain. For instance, OWC currently has late 2012 Mac mini models in stock from $369, and they come with options.\\n\\nAs standard, these come with 8GB RAM, but even keeping within $500, you have the option to upgrade that to 16GB RAM, and get a 250GB SSD. For only $519, you can have both 16GB RAM and 500GB SSD.\\n\\nOWC continually has offers on new and refurbished Macs of all descriptions. So, too, does Mac of All Trades.\\n\\nWhile you should check out both of these for any type of Mac, there are two more options that are chiefly concerned with MacBooks. Just because of the nature of Apple MacBooks, MacBook Airs, and MacBook Pros, and how much the cost new, you're typically going to have to be looking at quite an older model to get it under $500. Even so, though, what is older now was still the cutting edge when it was released, and Apple devices keep their value much longer.\\n\\nKeep an eye on Best Buy's MacBook deals. With all such resellers, availability will vary enormously, but for example, right now $500 would get you a choice of 20 different MacBooks.\\n\\nThose range from MacBook Air models through to 15-inch MacBook Pro ones, too, and they also range in the specifications of each of these.\\n\\nThe same rules about minimum specifications apply to notebook Macs as to desktop ones, except that through practicality, you may have to regard them as suggestions more than rules. Notebook Macs tend to come with less RAM than desktops. Just for example, of the 20 currently showing at Best Buy, only two come with 8GB RAM. The rest are between 2GB and 4GB.\\n\\nIt's the same thing with storage. Four of this set come with 500GB drives, and they are hard drives rather than SSD.\\n\\nYou'll find the same need to balance RAM, storage, and price, at Gazelle.com. Currently there's an early 2015 MacBook Air with 8GB RAM and 128GB SSD for $509 with coupon code EEWQAD9EGZ6G.\\n\\nNaturally, they sell out very quickly. You're going to be frustrated if you can't be a little flexible on the specifications -- and also the price. While you can come in exactly on $500, or even get Macs cheaper, being willing to stretch to something like $540 will help. It will mean you're likely to get what you need faster. Your new iPad or refurbished MacBook is not going to be any use to you at all without software. This is one area where Apple gear scores highly over PCs, though. Right out of the box, all Macs come with bundled software -- and it's very good.\\n\\nThis isn't some collection of cutdown Lite software that does barely anything until you buy the upgrade. And it isn't some collection of shareware or apps by developers you've never heard from before and won't hear from again.\\n\\nInstead, all Macs and iPads come Apple's own iWork suite, much better known as the word processor Pages, the spreadsheet Numbers, and the presentation software Keynote. If Keynote was good enough for Steve Jobs to use in his world-famous presentations, it's good enough for all of us.\\n\\nUltimately, as important as the hardware is, it's the software that is going to make it right for you buy an iPad or a Mac. It's just a very good and fortunate fact that you can take it for granted that excellent software is either already installed -- or can be downloaded for free from the App Store. While many of Apple's retail prices were used throughout this guide, it often pays to shop at an Apple reseller thanks to aggressive deals offered on hardware. Cash discounts are readily available on everything from the latest iPad and MacBook Air models, to closeout configurations that offer upgrades for a fraction of the retail cost. The AppleInsider Apple Price Guides help you find the best bargains and compare deals quickly, with exclusive offers on nearly every model.\\n\\nApple Price Guides broken down by product line\",\n",

       "    'title': 'These Apple made sneakers from the 1990s just got sold for $10,000 at an auction',\n",
       "    'body': 'Yes, Apple did make sneakers but only for its employees, and they are definitely nowhere as high-tech as you may have thought them to be\\n\\nImagine what a pair of shoes made by Apple would look like? Minimalist and at the same time packing some bleeding edge technology. They could have Apple\\'s unmatched integration with other Apple devices such as your iPhone or your Apple Watch and show some vital information such as your step-count, calories burnt and your weight on their screens - read Apple Ecosystem.\\n\\nOr maybe they could use your biomechanical energy and convert it into electricity that could be used to charge your iPhone, or maybe they will come with Siri integration and you could command the shoes to self-lace. Just kidding!\\n\\nAs far fetched as these \"iSneaker\" ideas may seem, there have been plenty of unconfirmed rumors about a supposed smart shoe that Apple could be working on. And while it seems pretty unlikely that Apple could do something like Xiaomi and launch a smart shoe, the Cupertino-based tech giant actually did try its luck with apparels and sportswear in the early \\'90s, including a pair of Apple-branded sneakers.\\n\\nThe $10,000 \\'used\\' Apple Sneakers from 1990s\\n\\nNow, we all know that die-hard Apple fans and collectors don\\'t just want the latest iPhones from Apple. They will go to any length and will happily spend obscene amounts of money to get their hands on a piece of Apple\\'s history, be it the original iPhone 2G in an unopened condition, or any Apple memorabilia such as its vintage merchandise made for its employees. Just recently, a pair of rare Apple Computer sneakers that were designed for Apple employees got sold for almost $10,000 at an auction.\\n\\nThe vintage Apple sneakers were listed on Heritage Auctions, which is the same auction house that handled the recent bidding and eventual sale of an extremely rare Nintendo Play Station prototype that got sold for a whopping $360,000.\\n\\nThe auction house listed a used pair of size nine-and-a-half Apple sneakers featuring the classic Apple rainbow logo embroidered on the side, as part of a collection of \"Urban Art\" pieces. According to the listing, the shoes which were \"made by Apple\" in the early 1990s, were only given out to their employees, which makes them one of the rarest sneakers in existence.\\n\\nDespite the pair of sneakers being pre-worn and showing some minor wear and tear, they were otherwise in excellent condition, and attracted as many as 29 bids, going eventually to the highest bid of $9,687.\\n\\nNo takers for unused Apple sneakers\\n\\nIf you thought that is a ridiculously high price for a used pair of sneakers, a brand new pair of the same Apple sneakers was listed on Heritage Auctions back in June 2017 with a starting bid of $15,000. But unfortunately it didn\\'t have any buyers - or should we say bidders.\\n\\nThe pair of sneakers in immaculate condition were one of two \"never-worn prototypes\" created by Adidas for Apple, according to the Heritage Auctions listing. Although they hit the auction block with a starting price of $15,000, they were expected to start a bidding war of sorts between Apple fanatics and \"sneakerheads\" and were expected to go for as much as at least $36,000. However, there were no bidders for the pair and they are still listed on Heritage Auctions website as \"Not Sold.\"\\n\\nLater that year, a different model of Apple sneakers got sold in \"used condition\" for over $10,000 at an auction. This suggests that people are more interested in shoes that were used by Apple employees.\\n\\nOther popular Apple merchandise\\n\\nExpensive sneakers are not the only sought-after Apple merchandise. There have been several other exclusive items from Apple\\'s long history that have attracted insane bids at auctions and perhaps the most popular Apple merchandise with collectors are its apparels which include Apple t-shirts which Apple used to sell to its employees in the 1980\\'s at an exclusive company store that was closed for public.\\n\\nOther popular Apple collectibles include Macintosh hoodies and Apple merch from its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), which will be taking place online this year due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.',\n",

       "    'title': 'Goldman Sachs will get more anonymized data on Apple Card users',\n",
       "    'body': 'Apple updated its privacy policy on Apple Card this week in order to share more data with its card partner Goldman Sachs.\\n\\nThe larger data set is still be anonymized and will reportedly be used to allow Goldman Sachs to create a new credit assignment model so that more people are able to get approval for Apple Card.\\n\\nTechcrunch reported this morning that there will still be an opt-out option for the data sharing. Apple is also allowing users to opt-in to sharing more personal data with Goldman Sachs if you don\\'t get approved.\\n\\nSome of the personal data shared includes purchase history or Apple products, your Apple ID creation date, how much you spend with Apple and more. Apple is also finally adding details to its internal transactions so that purchases don\\'t just show a charge from Apple Services.\\n\\nHere\\'s the wording on the new policy with the changes in bold:\\n\\n\"You may be eligible for certain Apple Card programs provided by Goldman Sachs based on the information provided as part of your application. Apple may know whether you receive the invitation to participate and whether you accept or decline the invitation, and may share that information with Goldman Sachs to effectuate the program. Apple will not know additional details about your participation in the program.\\n\\nApple may use information about your account with Apple, such as the fact that you have Apple Card, for internal research and analytics purposes, such as financial forecasting. Apple may also use information about your relationship with Apple, such as what Apple products you have purchased, how long you have had your Apple ID, and how often you transact with Apple, to improve Apple Card by helping to identify Apple metrics that may assist Goldman Sachs in improving credit decisioning.\\n\\nNo personally identifiable information about your relationship with Apple will be shared with Goldman Sachs to identify the relevant Apple metrics. You can opt out of this use or your Apple relationship information by emailing our privacy team at dpo@apple.com with the subject line \"Apple Relationship Data and Apple Card.\" Applicants and cardholders may be able to choose to share the identified metrics with Goldman Sachs for re-evaluation of their offer of credit or to increase their credit line. Apple may share information about your relationship with Apple with our service providers, who are obligated to handle the information consistent with this notice and Apple instructions, are required to use reasonable security measures to protect any personal information received, and must delete the personal information as soon as they have completed the services.\"\\n\\nWhen Apple Card was introduced last year it was touted as the world\\'s most consumer-friendly credit card that put privacy first. Sharing more data with Goldman Sachs would obviously be worrisome to customers that value the privacy aspects of the card, however, it is still aggregated and anonymized so that it\\'s not personally identifiable.\\n\\nOne of the problems with the new policy though is that you have to opt-out by email instead of just directly in the Wallet app. Apple probably did it that way so that fewer people opt-out which will make Goldman Sachs happier. Still, Apple Card does more to protect users\\' data than pretty much every other credit card and the new data should be able to help Apple and Goldman Sachs add more features to card.',\n",

       "    'title': 'Apple Is Giving Away Free Money When You Add Funds to Your Apple ID',\n",
       "    'body': 'From now until April 3, iTunes and App Store customers in the United States, Canada, Australia, Germany, and a few other countries can get an extra 10 percent in store credit when adding up to $200 to their Apple ID (or the equivalent in local currency).\\n\\nWhile it may seem like sort of an odd deal with everything else that\\'s going on in the world right now, it\\'s actually pretty timely when you think about it, since with more folks staying home it\\'s a good incentive to rent or purchase media content from the iTunes Store, or perhaps even take the plunge into a subscription to Apple Music, Apple Arcade, or Apple TV+, since you\\'re effectively getting a 10 percent discount on any spending up to $200 -- provided of course you add the money to your account in advance.\\n\\nApple last offered this deal prior to Black Friday last year, although we didn\\'t really see it as a Black Friday sale, but rather a similar opportunity for customers to stock up on iTunes media and App Store apps in preparation for the holiday season.\\n\\nAdding money to your Apple ID is basically the same as purchasing an iTunes or App Store Gift Card and redeeming it. The funds are added as a credit balance on your account that can be used for all digital purchases from Apple.\\n\\nThis not only includes individual purchases of things like apps, movies, TV shows, music, and books, but also any subscriptions that are billed through your Apple ID, including not only Apple\\'s own services like Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and Apple News+ but also third-party subscriptions that are billed through iTunes and even in-app purchases.\\n\\nBasically, when it comes to digital purchases from the iTunes Store or App Store, any credit balance on your Apple ID is used up first. Once that credit balance runs out, whatever is left over goes to your normal payment method, even if that ends up being a split payment combining store credit and a credit/debit card payment (in fact, the Amazon trick for splitting payments that we shared earlier this year can also be used on the iTunes Store and App Store in a similar manner by converting your smaller gift cards into Apple ID credit).\\n\\nNote that in the same way that Apple differentiates between iTunes Gift Cards and Apple Store gift cards, an Apple ID balance can only be used for digital purchases, not purchases of physical items.\\n\\nThis means that you won\\'t be able to put this 10 percent bonus toward a new iPad Pro or MacBook Air, and there\\'s no way to convert it back to cash either. Once it\\'s on your account, you\\'ll have to spend it on digital items through the iTunes Store, App Store, or Apple subscriptions. There\\'s no time limit on your Apple ID balance, however, so you could conceivably just top it up and let it be whittled away to pay for a monthly Apple Music subscription over the course of a year or two, still effectively resulting in a savings of 10 percent by pre-paying.\\n\\nIf you\\'re part of a Family Sharing group, it\\'s important to keep in mind that Apple ID credit is not shared among family members. This is true even if you\\'re the family organizer.\\n\\nDespite the fact that it\\'s the family organizer\\'s payment method that\\'s normally used to pay for purchases for everyone in the family, this does not apply to the family organizer\\'s Apple ID Balance. Any Apple ID Balance on any family member\\'s account, including the organizer\\'s, is used only by that family member.\\n\\nSo in other words, if you add $200 to your Apple ID Balance (and get the $20 bonus), it will only be used for items purchased with your own Apple ID; purchases made by your spouse, kids, or other family members will still be billed directly to your credit or debit card. This can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you plan to use it, but it\\'s important to be aware of this limitation; if you\\'re expecting to top up a balance for your kids\\' gaming subscriptions, you\\'ll need to add it directly to their Apple ID and not your own.\\n\\nThat said, because of the way this works, it does allow you to take advantage of the 10 percent bonus promotion for each of your family members, since their credit will be used only by them. So you could, for instance, add $200 to your family organizer Apple ID to cover the cost of an Apple Music subscription for a couple of years, and then also add another $100 (with another $10 bonus) to a kids\\' account to keep their Roblox subscription going at a discount.\\n\\nSo with all of that in mind, here\\'s how to top up your Apple ID and take advantage of the bonus money that Apple is giving away right now.\\n\\nAs noted, you\\'ll only be able to take advantage of this offer once, and it\\'s only good for up to $200 (which is the maximum you can add to your Apple ID in a single transaction anyway), so if you want the maximum $20 bonus you\\'ll need to put $200 on in a single transaction.\\n\\nOnce you\\'ve added money to your Apple ID Balance, you can check how much is left by repeating steps 1 through 6 above and looking for the \"Apple ID Balance\" line above the Add Funds to Apple ID option. You can also see it by tapping your photo in the top-right corner of the App Store or iTunes Store apps.',\n",

       "    'body': \"Contrary to its name apple butter does not contain any traces of dairy-based ingredient as its preparation involves no dairy products, however, the term butter is used to define its butter-like physical characteristics and its application as a spread. Apple butter is a traditional condiment originating in the Europe and also being used traditionally in North America.\\n\\nApple butter is a fruit butter which is prepared from apples that can be either fresh, frozen, or dried in addition with other ingredients such as cider, spices, sweeteners etc. by a long duration of slow cooking until the sugar present in the mixture caramelizes, giving apple butter its characteristic deep brown colour. Majority of the manufacturers add apple cider as an ingredient in the preparation of apple butter to improve its flavour and acid content. Addition of apple cider also provides the similar taste of apple butter which is produced by traditional or old-fashioned methods, thus enhancing the palatability of the product and increasing the demand for apple butter among the consumer.\\n\\nRequest For Report Brochure For Latest Industry Insights @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=35099\\n\\nFurthermore, many key players also add a small amount of vinegar and spices such as cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg etc. to give their product a distinct character, which helps them in differentiating their products from the others. In the recent years, preference for traditional condiments that date back is steadily regaining traction among various consumers worldwide. Thus, consumers around the world have been developing a taste for dishes that contain condiments such as apple butter and this is a key factor expected to drive the growth of the apple butter market over the forecast period.\\n\\nApple Butter Market: Segmentation\\n\\nGlobal Apple Butter market can be segmented on the basis of nature, grade, packaging, distribution channel, and region.\\n\\nOn the basis of nature, the apple butter market can be segmented into organic and conventional. The organic segment is expected to exhibit substantial growth rate in the global apple butter market owing to its preference by the ever-increasing health-conscious consumer base. However, the conventional apple butter segment is expected to dominate the market with moderate demand owing to its lesser cost.\\n\\nOn the basis of grade, the apple butter market can be segmented into grade A, grade C, and substandard grade. On the basis of packaging, apple butter market is segmented into glass jars, cans and others. Jars segment is expected to dominate the market over the forecast period, as the glass jar, being transparent enables excellent product visibility, thereby scoring more in terms of consumer satisfaction. Moreover, they also provide premium feel and aesthetics to the final product. On the basis of distribution channel, apple butter market is segmented into modern grocery retailers, traditional grocery retailer, and online stores. Modern grocery retailer segment is further sub-segmented into hypermarkets/supermarket, convenience stores, mom and pop stores, and discount stores. Traditional grocery retailers segment is further sub-segmented into food & drink speciality stores, independent small groceries and others.\\n\\nApple Butter Market: Dynamics\\n\\nIncreasing urbanization has led an explosive growth of ready-to-eat and ready-to-cook food products worldwide owing to the hectic lifestyles of consumers. In addition, consumers are also developing taste for traditional cuisine, condiments, sauces etc. as consumer perceive them to be more nutritional and minimally processed, which is expected to drive the growth of apple butter market over the forecast period. However, lower shelf visibility of apple butter in many countries of APAC, Latin America, and MEA region, owing to the low concentration of manufacturers coupled with lower consumer awareness of apple butter is anticipated to restrain the growth of global apple butter market over the forecast period. Furthermore, apple butter is highly susceptible to spoilage and thus to prevent the growth of the harmful microorganism, many manufacturers add chemical preservatives and high fructose corn syrup, thus creating a negative impact among health-conscious consumers and is expected to hamper the growth of apple butter market in the near future.\\n\\nApple Butter Market: Regional Outlook\\n\\nOn the basis of the regional outlook, apple butter market is segmented into five different regions: North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East and Africa and Asia Pacific. On analyzing the Apple Butter market at the global level, North America is expected to dominate the apple butter market followed by Europe, owing to increasing traction of apple butter products as it being consumed traditionally.\\n\\nObtain Report Details @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/apple-butter-market.html\\n\\nApple Butter Market: Key Player:\\n\\nSome of the major players operating in apple butter market include Eden Foods Inc., Musselman's, SHILOH FARMS, Walden Farms International, White House Foods, The J.

       "    'title': 'Open brief Tim Cook over coronavirus: Apple Stores wereldwijd gesloten',\n",
       "    'body': 'Apple voert maatregelen tegen coronavirus op\\n\\nApple kreeg afgelopen week wat kritiek door op vrolijke toon WWDC 2020 nieuwe stijl aan te kondigen, zonder ook maar het woord \\'corona\\' of \\'COVID-19\\' in de mond te nemen. Google pakte dat heel anders aan. Een officieel standpunt vanuit Apple bleef tot nu toe uit, al werden er al wel diverse maatregelen genomen. Zo gingen de Apple Stores in China en Italië tijdelijk op slot, werd reizen beperkt tot het strikt noodzakelijke en moesten kantoormedewerkers vaker thuiswerken. Ook werden in sommige Apple Stores de bezoekersdichtheid beperkt door minder supportafspraken in te plannen en mensen beperkt binnen te laten.\\n\\nBijna alle Apple Stores gesloten\\n\\nGisteravond werd al bekend dat alle Apple Stores in Spanje voorlopig gesloten zijn, nu er in het land de noodtoestand is afgekondigd. Apple gaat echter een stap verder: Tim Cook kondigt in een open brief aan dat vanaf vandaag ook alle andere Apple Stores wereldwijd gesloten zullen zijn, tot 27 maart. Alleen winkels in Groot-China biljven open. Op het moment van schrijven zijn de aangepaste openingstijden nog niet te zien op de website van Apple, maar dit zal spoedig worden aangepast.\\n\\nVoor alle kantoormedewerkers is het mogelijk om op afstand te werken. Wie nog wel naar kantoor moet, krijgt instructies om extra afstand te houden tot collega\\'s. Verder zal alles extra goed worden schoongemaakt en worden er gezondheid- en temperatuur-checks uitgevoerd. Medewerkers op uurbasis worden gewoon doorbetaald en medewerkers kunnen extra tijd krijgen om voor een ziek familielid of voor thuisblijvende kinderen te zorgen.\\n\\nApple heeft tot nu toe $15 miljoen gedoneerd om het virus te bestrijden. Dat is ook te lezen in een tweet die Cook rondstuurde:\\n\\nFysiek contact vermijden\\n\\nCook benoemt in zijn brief allereerst de \\'Apple-familie\\' in Groot-China. Het aantal infecties is daar dramatisch gedaald, maar de gevolgen zijn nog steeds goed te merken. De winkels zijn er wel gewoon open en de toeleveringsketen van Apple is weer grotendeels hersteld. Maar nu is de rest van de wereld aan de beurt. En volgens Cook is één van de lessen die we uit China hebben geleerd, om fysiek sociaal contact te vermijden en niet te dicht bij elkaar te gaan staan. Vandaar dat er extra maatregelen komen, waarvan de sluiting van alle Apple Stores buiten Groot-China de belangrijkste is.\\n\\nCook sluit zijn brief af met een bedankje aan alle helden die nu in actie moeten komen: artsen, verplegend personeel, onderzoekers en eerste hulpmedewerkers. Zoals president Lincoln al zei: \"As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew.\"\\n\\nWat betekent het voor jou?\\n\\nMoet je spullen van de Apple Store hebben, dan kun je die gewoon online kopen bij Apple, maar je kunt uiteraard ook bij allerlei andere retailers terecht.\\n\\nHeb je support nodig, dan kun je op support.apple.com terecht en alles online afhandelen. Je kunt bijvoorbeeld chatten of bellen met personeel en moet je spullen laten repareren, dan kun je ze opsturen. Je zou in de tussentijd ook terecht kunnen bij Apple-erkende serviceproviders zoals Card Services en Amac.\\n\\nView this post on Instagram\\n\\nAt Apple, there\\'s nothing more important to us than people -- our customers, our team members and the communities we serve. To protect the health and well-being of everyone, we will be closing all Apple retail stores outside of Greater China until March 27. I am profoundly grateful to our exceptional team members all around the world who have shown such deep care for our customers and each other during this difficult time. Our teams at Apple will continue to provide exceptional service. Our online stores are open at apple.com, or you can download the Apple Store app on the App Store. For service and support, customers can visit support.apple.com. Thank you to every member of our Apple family for all you do -- today and every day.\\n\\nA post shared by Deirdre O\\'Brien (@deirdre.at.apple) on Mar 13, 2020 at 11:48pm PDT\\n\\nHieronder kun je de volledige brief lezen.\\n\\nApple\\'s COVID-19 response\\n\\nAPPLE STATEMENT March 13, 2020\\n\\nTo the worldwide Apple family,\\n\\nThe global spread of COVID-19 is affecting every one of us. At Apple, we are people first, and we do what we do with the belief that technology can change lives and the hope that it can be a valuable tool in a moment like this. Teachers are innovating to make remote lessons come alive. Companies are experimenting with new ways to stay productive. And medical experts can diagnose illnesses and reach millions with critical updates in the blink of an eye. We are all adapting and responding in our own way, and Apple wants to continue to play a role in helping individuals and communities emerge stronger.\\n\\nBut this global effort -- to protect the most vulnerable, to study this virus, and to care for the sick -- requires all of our care, and all of our participation. And I want to update you about the ways in which we are doing our part.\\n\\nGiving Back\\n\\nApple\\'s committed donations to the global COVID-19 response -- both to help treat those who are sick and to help lessen the economic and community impacts of the pandemic -- today reached $15 million worldwide.\\n\\nWe\\'re also announcing that we are matching our employee donations two-to-one to support COVID-19 response efforts locally, nationally and internationally.\\n\\nIn Our Offices and Stores\\n\\nFirst, I want to recognize Apple\\'s family in Greater China. Though the rate of infections has dramatically declined, we know COVID-19\\'s effects are still being strongly felt. I want to express my deep gratitude to our team in China for their determination and spirit. As of today, all of our stores in Greater China have reopened. I also want to thank our operations team and partners for their remarkable efforts to restore our supply chain. What we\\'ve learned together has helped us all develop the best practices that are assisting enormously in our global response.\\n\\nOne of those lessons is that the most effective way to minimize risk of the virus\\'s transmission is to reduce density and maximize social distance. As rates of new infections continue to grow in other places, we\\'re taking additional steps to protect our team members and customers.\\n\\nWe will be closing all of our retail stores outside of Greater China until March 27. We are committed to providing exceptional service to our customers. Our online stores are open at www.apple.com, or you can download the Apple Store app on the App Store. For service and support, customers can visit support.apple.com. I want to thank our extraordinary Retail teams for their dedication to enriching our customers\\' lives. We are all so grateful to you.\\n\\nIn all of our offices, we are moving to flexible work arrangements worldwide outside of Greater China. That means team members should work remotely if their job allows, and those whose work requires them to be on site should follow guidance to maximize interpersonal space. Extensive, deep cleaning will continue at all sites. In all our offices, we are rolling out new health screenings and temperature checks.\\n\\nAll of our hourly workers will continue to receive pay in alignment with business as usual operations. We have expanded our leave policies to accommodate personal or family health circumstances created by COVID-19 -- including recovering from an illness, caring for a sick loved one, mandatory quarantining, or childcare challenges due to school closures.\\n\\nFor Our Users and Partners\\n\\nWe know our users depend on Apple products all the time, and especially in times like these. We\\'re bringing the same creativity and passion to meeting this challenge that we do in everything else we undertake.\\n\\nApple News has launched a new COVID-19 section, where users can be sure that they can find the latest verified reporting from trusted news outlets.\\n\\nAs you may have seen, our annual Worldwide Developers Conference will be in an entirely new online format this year. We see this as an opportunity to bring together developers around the world in an innovative way.\\n\\nLooking Ahead\\n\\nThere is no mistaking the challenge of this moment. The entire Apple family is indebted to the heroic first responders, doctors, nurses, researchers, public health experts and public servants globally who have given every ounce of their spirit to help the world meet this moment. We do not yet know with certainty when the greatest risk will be behind us.\\n\\nAnd yet I have been inspired by the humanity and determination I have seen from all corners of our global community. As President Lincoln said in a time of great adversity: \"The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s always how Apple has chosen to meet big challenges. And it\\'s how we\\'ll rise to meet this one, too.\\n\\nTim',\n",

       "    'body': 'Save for a few minor changes such as larger screens, different materials and various watch band designs, the look of the watch hasn\\'t changed much since Apple introduced the first Apple Watch in 2014. And this year will be no different.\\n\\nRumors of a circular watch face on the Apple Watch have been making the rounds for a few years now. Some of its Android counterparts like the Samsung Galaxy Watch have circular designs, so it wouldn\\'t be too much of a stretch to think Apple would follow suit. To add fuel to the fire, the company has also issued a couple Apple Watch patents that show a round display. But so far, it\\'s just a possibility; the existence of a patent doesn\\'t guarantee Apple will use it in a product. Even if one of these patents does become a reality, it would likely take years. A change this big would require Apple to rework the hardware and software of the watch, and so far we haven\\'t heard anything that would indicate it\\'s happening in 2020.\\n\\nThe Apple Watch has tons of customizable watch faces (known as \"complications\") ranging from animated Disney characters to weather-centric interfaces. But Apple still hasn\\'t loosened the reins for third-party watch faces, and we don\\'t see that changing anytime soon.\\n\\nInstead Apple might allow users to share watch faces. According to a 9to5Mac, each watch face configuration will be shared as a unique file via AirDrop. The report, which cites leaked iOS 14 code as the source of its information, also says WatchOS 7, the next version of Apple\\'s smartwatch software, will add an analog-style tachymeter to its design options that would measure speed and distance.\\n\\nYou may also be able to use shared albums from your photos app to create a customized watch face that cycles through the photos in that album. That means family members could add individual photos to the shared album for everyone in the group to see on their wrists.\\n\\nLastly, for patriotic users, WatchOS 7 may add an \"international\" option that lets you choose a country\\'s flag as your watch face.\\n\\nFitness has been at the core of the Apple Watch since its launch, and this year Apple may take it even further. According to MacRumors, the company is working on a standalone fitness app. Unlike the existing Activity app that tracks your progress and is already on the Apple Watch (and iPhone), this one would give you guided workouts for an assortment of different activities such as running, cycling, rowing, strength training, dance and yoga.\\n\\nThere\\'s no shortage of third-party fitness apps like this for the Apple Watch, but a native fitness app could put a lot of those out of business. The app would be available on the iPhone and Apple TV as well as the Apple Watch. And it might be free. The MacRumors report says there\\'s no evidence of in-app purchases, but that doesn\\'t necessarily rule out a subscription based approach like Apple Music.\\n\\nThis could finally be the year when Apple Watch gets native sleep tracking. Since acquiring the sleep sensor Beddit back in 2017, a tracker that sits under the mattress, there have been rumors about Apple integrating a similar feature in the Apple Watch. A \"Sleep app\" was also accidentally mentioned in a screenshot of Apple\\'s preinstalled Alarm app in the App Store. The image was spotted by a reader of MacRumos back in October, and has since been removed.\\n\\nCurrently, sleep tracking is available on the Apple Watch through third-party apps and one of the biggest hurdles for Apple to offer it natively has been battery life. The current Apple Watch models last about a day and a half of normal use, but a feature like this would require overnight monitoring. This would likely drain the battery much faster. It\\'s in the company\\'s best interest to solve this issue soon though; many Apple Watch competitors like Fitbit and Samsung have had it on their devices for years.\\n\\nEven if the Series 6 doesn\\'t have native sleep tracking, Apple will likely continue expanding health and wellness features for the next Apple Watch.\\n\\nThis year\\'s big health feature could be what\\'s known as SPO2 tracking. This would allow the watch to measure your blood oxygen levels and alert you if it dips below a certain threshold, according to 9to5Mac. The Apple Watch already does something similar with heart rate, and alerts you if it detects an abnormally high, low or irregular heart rhythm.\\n\\nFor this to be possible, the Series 6 could require a new type of sensor, likely a pulse oximeter. But it might even be able to pull it off using the existing hardware. The Apple Watch currently tracks VO2 max (or maximum oxygen consumption) in the Activity app using the GPS and heart rate sensor during exercise.\\n\\nOther health rumors include glucose and blood-pressure monitoring on the next Apple Watch, but these could be further off.\\n\\nThe iOS 14 code reportedly also references new tools for parents, such as the ability to set up two Apple Watches on one iPhone. This would help parents who want to use an Apple Watch to keep tabs on their kids, but aren\\'t ready to give them their own iPhone to go along with it.',\n",

Although there is a strong chance that Apple could cancel WWDC this year because of the coronavirus outbreak.\\n\\nIt's an event for developers and therefore it tends to be a software-focused event. You can expect Apple to demonstrate updated versions of the macOS, iOS, tvOS, watchOS and iPadOS operating systems. This is why the event is so popular with the public: we'll get a teaser of the new features that will soon be added to our iPhones, iPads, Macs and other Apple products.\\n\\nWe also tend to see presentations from third-party developer partners who will talk about how they are updating their software to work with the new platforms.\\n\\nIt's not always just a software event, though; in the past we have seen hardware announcements too. At WWDC 2017 Apple launched the iMac Pro, a new MacBook and MacBook Pro, a new iPad Pro and the HomePod, for example. If you go further back Apple would actually unveil new iPhones at WWDC - such as in 2010 when it revealed the iPhone 4 - but that kind of thing would be a huge surprise these days.\\n\\nThe hardware announcements that Apple makes around the time of WWDC tend to be high-end, professional Macs rather than consumer-oriented products, because the audience for the event tends to be less mainstream.\\n\\nWhen is WWDC 2020?\\n\\nWe'd expect WWDC to run from 8-12 June 2020, if it's not cancelled because of health worries.\\n\\nThat's not official yet, but we can make an educated guess based on past behaviour. WWDC always takes place over the course of a full week in early June, kicking off with a keynote address on the Monday at which various Apple execs present the new features coming to the operating systems.\\n\\nBased on the past few years (outlined below) we expect WWDC to fall around the 8 June. This date is a little problematic, at least in the UK, because 8 June is a Bank Holiday in 2020 (the May bank holiday has been moved to June to celebrate VE-Day). But the US will not be observing this with a public holiday and it's unlikely that Apple will take this into consideration.\\n\\nWWDC 2020: Monday 8 June? WWDC 2019: Started Monday 3 June WWDC 2018: Monday 4 June WWDC 2017: Monday 5 June WWDC 2016: Monday 13 June WWDC 2015: Monday 8 June WWDC 2014: Monday 2 June WWDC 2013: Monday 10 June WWDC 2012: Monday 11 June WWDC 2011: Monday 6 June WWDC 2010: Monday 7 June Will Apple cancel WWDC 2020?\\n\\nAt the moment, unfortunately, it looks highly likely that the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak - also known as COVID-19 - will lead Apple to cancel WWDC in 2020.\\n\\nNumerous other conferences have been cancelled (or made online-only) for the same reason. Fellow tech giants Microsoft, Facebook and Google have taken this step with various gatherings, and it's strongly rumoured that the E3 gaming event, which was scheduled for 9-11 June and would very likely have overlapped with WWDC, will be cancelled too.\\n\\nSanta Clara County Public Health, which is Apple's local body, has issued a mandatory order banning public gatherings of 1,000 or more people, which would make WWDC impossible in its usual form. That order began on 11 March and is initially scheduled to last for three weeks, but may be extended as the outbreak develops.\\n\\nWe'll keep a close eye on developments and update this article with any news. You can read a more detailed discussion of the situation in Will Apple cancel WWDC?\\n\\nHow do I watch WWDC?\\n\\nApple is likely to stream the keynote over the internet so you will be able to watch WWDC on your iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac and other products.\\n\\nIf you're a developer you might even be able to get tickets to attend WWDC. Tickets to WWDC are allocated via a ballot which you will have to enter if you want to get WWDC tickets in 2020.\\n\\nWhat will Apple launch at WWDC 2020?\\n\\nWe can confidently state that WWDC 2020 will tell us about the updates coming to Apple's various operating systems. It is also possible that the event will include new Macs, more information below.\\n\\nBefore we start with our predictions we'll recap on what Apple's done at WWDC over the past few years:\\n\\nWWDC 2019: Apple told us about iOS 13 and macOS Catalina. It also unveiled the new Mac Pro and new display. WWDC 2018: Apple revealed details of iOS 12 and macOS Mojave. There were no hardware updates at that event. WWDC 2017: Apple talked about iOS 11 and macOS 10.13 High Sierra. We also got our first look at the new iMac Pro which was previewed alongside the launch of new iMacs and an updated MacBook Pro and MacBook. Software\\n\\nIn terms of software previews at WWDC 2020 we expect the following:\\n\\niOS 14\\n\\nWe have more information about the new features coming in iOS 14 here.\\n\\nmacOS 10.16\\n\\nHere is what we expect from the next version of macOS here.\\n\\niPadOS\\n\\nWe have details of what we expect to see in iPadOS 14 here.\\n\\nOther software\\n\\nWe will also hear about tvOS, watchOS and HomePodOS. Apple may also speak about upcoming changes to its apps such as Pages, Numbers and Keynote, and iMovie, Music, and more.\\n\\nHardware\\n\\nNow for the hardware we could see at WWDC 2020:\\n\\nNew-look iMac\\n\\nWith a design that dates back more than a decade a change is well overdue for the iMac. We are hoping that 2020 will bring a new iMac with a bigger display (made possible by smaller bezels and a thinner 'chin'). Read more about the 2020 iMac.\\n\\nIf Apple's updating the iMac we could also see an update to the iMac Pro.\\n\\n13in MacBook Pro\\n\\nHaving launched a 16in MacBook Pro at the end of 2019 it's now the 13in MacBook Pro's turn for an update. Apple is expected to start selling a new 13in MacBook Pro in the first half of 2020. The big change coming to the new model is a new keyboard. Apple's laptops have been plagued with issues linked to the keyboard design since 2016 and Apple's no doubt racing to address them. Read more about the new MacBook Pro for 2020.\\n\\nNew MacBook Air\\n\\nThe MacBook Air will also get that new keyboard. More information about what to expect from the new MacBook Air.\\n\\nMacBook\\n\\nApple discontinued the MacBook in 2019, but we don't think it's the last we'll see of the consumer Mac laptop. We believe that Apple has plans for a new Mac that will use an Apple-made processor and potentially combine some of the benefits of the iPad - and maybe even a touch screen. We really hope Apple has something up its sleeve, and we think we could get a first look at this new MacBook at WWDC. Read about the rumours about the new MacBook.\",\n",

       "    'body': 'Rumor has it, Apple will be releasing not three new iPhones like last year, not even four new iPhones, but a whopping 5 new iPhones in 2020. Sure, it\\'s nothing compared to the 879 new phones Samsung will likely release this year, but for Apple, it\\'s a lot. Like... a lot a lot.\\n\\nWhen Steve Jobs announced the original iPhone, it was just that, the original iPhone. There were variations in storage size but not in the original iPhone. It was literally meant to be one iPhone for everyone.\\n\\nExcept for the price. It started at $499 for 4GB.\\n\\nNow, 13 years later, rumor has it we\\'ll be getting upwards of 5 new iPhone and at the widest price ranges ever.\\n\\nSo, how did we get here? I\\'m going to ignore storage tiers for this just to keep it simple, but that original $499 iPhone was cost-corrected quickly, first by price-dropping the original from to $499 for 8GB, and making a deal with AT&T to subsidize the second-generation iPhone 3G down to $199 for 8GB. Full price went to $599, though, but few people ever saw or sought that.\\n\\nThen, when Apple introduced the third-generation iPhone 3GS, it kept the same $199 subsidized and $599 unsubsidized price, this time for 16GB, but did something else interesting -- it decided to address a more entry-level market for the first time as well. Not by introducing a less expensive model but by keeping the previous iPhone 3G on sale for $99 subsidized, $499 unsubsidized.\\n\\nThere was still only one new iPhone a year, though Apple added color options -- black and white -- but Apple had added a pricing option as well.\\n\\nWhen the fourth-generation iPhone 4 rolled around, Apple was facing a world where almost everyone in the U.S. who wanted an iPhone and was willing to stay or switch to AT&T to get it... had gotten it, and to continue to grow, Apple had to add additional carriers.\\n\\nSo, about 7 months later, the first Verizon iPhone 4 launched. Everything stayed pretty much the same through the 5th generation iPhone 4s, though now with both GSM for AT&T and international, and CDMA for Verizon and eventually Sprint, models. While the subsidized price stayed at $199 for 16GB, the unsubsidized price increased to $649.\\n\\nBut, with each new model, Apple kept keeping around the previous model for $100 less. Until the 7th generation iPhone 5s.\\n\\nWhether the iPhone 5 and its chamfered edges was just too expensive to produce at a discount, Apple wasn\\'t certain 64-bit and Touch ID or even the first gold finish were enough differentiation, the smartphone and iPhone markets were maturing and the company simply wanted to test a different strategy, or... yes, when the iPhone 5s was introduced, the iPhone 5 was discontinued, and the iPhone 5c was launched not as a price drop but as a new less-expensive iPhone in its place.\\n\\nInstead of another glass and metal premium blockbuster like the iPhone 5s, one that debuted in the fall, spiked over the holidays, and then declined until the next fall saw the next blockbuster, with the iPhone 5c Apple tried something more unabashedly plastic in fun pop art colors, meant to be more like a TV show, that sat on the shelf and sold for an entire season.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the iPhone 5c was new in candy coating only. The processor and camera were still the previous year\\'s, and while the colors popped, the sales did not.\\n\\nStill, it was the first time Apple expanded to making two new iPhones at a time. And that\\'s what companies do over time. They segment. They try to find a large enough group of potential customers that aren\\'t buying or paying as much as they might and they try to make a product that\\'s more appealing to that group. It\\'s why there are so many different kinds of cars and TVs. It why Apple eventually made four different kinds of iPods and a half-dozen different kinds of Macs.\\n\\nAnd it\\'s why the next year, with the 8th generation iPhone 6, Apple did it again. This time not with plastic and metal, less expensive and premium, but with double metal and premium, and something else new - big and bigger.\\n\\nSee, Android phones had been swelling for years. Apple had gotten a little bigger with the iPhone 5 but nothing compared to the Android behemoths of the time. And what\\'s better than owning almost all the profit in the premium market for 4-inch phones and under? Owning almost all the profit in the premium market for phones 4-inches and over as well.\\n\\nAnd, it also allowed Apple to introduce a third price point, instead of $100 less expensive, this time it was $100 more. $299 subsidized for 16GB, $749 unsubsidized.\\n\\nThat done, Apple turned its attention back to the less expensive market. But, instead of making a plastic iPhone 6c to sit beneath the upcoming iPhone 6s, instead of just making a less expensive iPhone, Apple decided to kill two markets with one product.\\n\\nSee, some people, some very premium people, didn\\'t like the big and bigger iPhones. They still wanted a smaller iPhone. But not one like the 5c. Not one with previous generations specs that compromised on performance and camera. One with the latest specs and all the performance and camera.\\n\\nSo, Apple went back to the iPhone 5 platform and made the iPhone SE. And it had almost all the latest features, but the smaller size many still loved. What\\'s more, because the iPhone 5 platform had been all paid down, Apple could still offer the iPhone SE for less. $399 for 16GB.\\n\\nIt satisfied both the less expensive and the smaller iPhone markets. And even Apple underestimated the demand for it.\\n\\nWhat\\'s more, when you added the iPhone SE to the 10th generation iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, even with the former staggered six months before the two latters, Apple proved it could produce three new iPhones in a year.\\n\\nThe iPhone 7 remained at $649 but now for 32GB of storage, but the iPhone 7 Plus with its extra camera, went up an extra $20 to $769. It remained a bestseller, though, showing there was a higher-end market for higher-end features.\\n\\nAll of those things would come into play the very next year, when Apple not only announced three new iPhone models all at the same time, but an all-new model on top of all of them.\\n\\nThe 11th-generation iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus were joined by the 12th generation iPhone X. And, not only did the iPhone 8 jump $50 to $699 for 64GB, and the iPhone 8 Plus, $30 to $799, the iPhone X dropped at a whopping $999.\\n\\nApple thought that if it brought new technologies forward, even if it cost more to make and sell, there\\'d be a market for it even over the existing premium models.\\n\\nAnd, despite a lot of doomsaying, they were right.\\n\\nSo, the next year they amped it up even more. Instead of two traditional flagships and a higher-end model, Apple went for two higher-end models: the iPhone XS and the new iPhone XS Max for $1099.\\n\\nThen, Apple did a partial iPhone 5c play and slid a new, less expensive model underneath it. The iPhone XR for $749 for 64GB. It was colorful, but it wasn\\'t compromised like the 5c was. The XR had the latest processor and main camera.\\n\\nBut, there was an optics problem. Where the iPhone X was seen as an extra, above and beyond, the XS was seen as just the next iPhone. And at $999, it was also seen as out-of-touch expensive. Even the iPhone XR, which was seen as less expensive, was $50 more than the iPhone 8 had been.\\n\\nAnd, that created a lot of negative press and sentiment. Especially during a time when the overall smartphone market was reaching saturation and China especially was struggling.\\n\\nSo, last year, Apple switched gears again. Still three new iPhones, still at the same time, but this time, they gave the iPhone 11 no modifier name to the base model, and carefully rebranded the higher end models to iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max.\\n\\nWhat\\'s more, Apple brought that base model pricing back down to $699 for 64GB and $749 for 128GB.\\n\\nAnd, because perception is everything, the market proved much, much happier. Especially after the highest-profile competition, Google and Samsung, came in more expensive for the Pixel 4 and Galaxy S20.\\n\\nThis year, it sounds like Apple is going to repeat some form of all its previous playbooks, but with some new twists.\\n\\nFirst, in the spring, a next-generation iPhone SE, maybe called the iPhone 9, that instead of being less expensive and smaller will be less expensive and still have a Home button. An iPhone 8 body with, hopefully, iPhone 11 brains. And hopefully once again at $399.\\n\\nThen, two regular priced iPhones. The iPhones 12. One the same size as the iPhone XR and iPhone 11, and the other slightly smaller, again meant to appeal to people for whom current iPhones are just too physically big.\\n\\nBasically, a way to satisfy the other half of the iPhone SE market, the small but premium market. Maybe at the same $699, but hopefully even for a little less, like $549. We\\'ll have to wait and see where Apple thinks the \"make it up in volume\" pricing really is.\\n\\nTaken together, the iPhone 9 and smaller iPhone 12 provide a pretty compelling, fairly complete answer to people who want smaller iPhones, but with the traditional Home button but also with the new, modern design.\\n\\nAt the top end, the iPhone 12 Pro moves to the same size as the iPhone XR and 11 as well, but the iPhone 12 Pro Max gets even bigger. Part of that will be to support the extra power and battery needed for mmWave 5G, see my previous video. But it might also let Apple explore even higher ends again, and display sizes for people who use their iPhone as their primary computer and literally want the biggest screen on it possible. Like a tiny tablet, yes please.\\n\\nCould still be $999 and $1099, or the 5G and size could bump them up to $1049 and $1149 or even $1099 and $1199 respectively.\\n\\nEither way, that\\'s an incredible spread of new iPhone models and price points. Sure, it\\'ll take launching one new iPhone in the spring and an unprecedented four new iPhones in the fall, but it\\'s something Apple has been preparing for for the better part of the last decade.\\n\\nAnd, again, this is what happens in a mature market. It\\'s what happened with the iPod, the Mac, even the iPad. Apple is starting to be able to do it at iPhone scale, which is pretty much the biggest scale imaginable. Again, if the rumors are true and if Apple has gotten its market segmentation and demand forecasting right.',\n",

       "    'body': \"If you use an iPhone with iOS 13, you will probably use the App Switcher every day to quit apps completely or to switch back and forth between the individual windows. The problem is that the apps are arranged linearly next to each other and depending on the number of open apps, searching and tapping may take some time. Many users don't even select apps from within the App Switch, but quickly swipe down on the iPhone to enter the name of the app in the search window. This works much faster. Apple probably wants to give the App Switcher more importance again under iOS 14. Below, in the video, you can see how multitasking under iOS 14 might look like in the future. According to this, the apps no longer slide close together on the screen when swiping up, but appear tile-like. They can then be selected or swiped away. In addition, this view should allow you to move the apps to a new multitasking overview. Apple could enable users to separate really important apps that are changed often from apps that are running in the background.\\n\\nIt does indeed seem to be true: Apple will release over-ear headphones later this year, which will complement the wireless AirPods and AirPods Pro headphones. Concrete clues are provided by the code of iOS 14, which is partly circulating on the net and reveals some Apple secrets. The Apple site 9to5mac was able to find new headphone symbols that are displayed under iOS 14, for example in the Bluetooth section or when the headphones are switched on and are near the iPhone or iPad. Thus, the presumed Apple Studio Headphones will probably have similar pairing features to the AirPods Pro. The emerging logos also prove that Apple will release the new headphones in two colors, black and white.\\n\\nThat Apple's wearable is becoming more and more of a home lab and lifesaver should be clear thanks to the ECG function and fall detection. But the Californian company is probably working more and more on the expansion of medical functions under watchOS 7, like measuring the oxygen content in the blood (SpO2). Again it was 9to5mac who found references to this feature in the code of iOS 14. With the measured values diseases can be detected early and cardiovascular problems can be avoided. Fitbit already offers this feature to users of its fitness wristbands. On the Apple Watch, users could have the oxygen content of their blood measured regularly. If the measured value falls below a certain threshold, users are asked to consult a doctor. This could be done by using the infrared sensor of the heart rate monitor already installed in many Apple Watch models. However, it is quite possible that Apple will develop a separate SpO2 sensor that can provide accurate readings. Thus, this feature would probably be exclusively reserved for the latest Apple Watch generation.\\n\\nAnother medical function, which is currently possible with the Apple Watch Series 4 and Series 5, will be improved with watchOS 7. While the wristwatch already provides good results in the area of ECG measurement, many users have complained in the past about ambiguous measurement data at heart rates between 100 and 120 beats per minute. Apple claims to have worked with doctors and scientists to improve this situation.\\n\\nThird-party providers have long been represented in the App Store with any applications. Sleep trackers are often used on the Apple Watch. But for a long time, users of the Apple Watch have wondered why the probably simplest function for wearables on Apple's watch hasn't found its way into it yet. This should change with watchOS 7. Because as was discovered again in the code of iOS 14, Apple is working on a sleep tracker for the Apple Watch. With this sleep tracker, it should be possible to measure the quality of your sleep, to get insight into the different sleep phases like REM-sleep or deep sleep and to set smart wake-up times.\\n\\nThus, most sleep trackers allow you to set a wake-up period that doesn't wake the user in deep sleep, but in a light sleep phase. To avoid the problem of the Apple Watch dying overnight, users should be reminded in the evening to charge the watch before going to bed. All sleep data will probably be clearly summarized within the health app in the sleep section.\\n\\nBesides the new features, Apple will probably roll out numerous new watch faces for its Apple Watch. In addition, Apple Watch users will finally be able to exchange their own watch faces with each other. Parents whose children use an Apple Watch should benefit from the new Kids Watch interface. With its help, the watch can be configured manually and in a child-friendly manner on the wrist of the child.\\n\\nWe have already reported that Apple will also add more features to the iPad and the new iPad Pro. Thus, Apple's tablet is moving closer to the Mac sector on its tenth birthday and is thus moving further away from the shadow of the iPhone.\\n\\nWith iPadOS 13, Apple had already given the tablet an independent operating system. Now new features could follow. So it is believed that Apple has developed a new keyboard that not only has buttons integrated, but also a trackpad. Apple's Magic Trackpad is built into all MacBooks and is also available as a mouse replacement for iMac. With the compatibility between iPad and trackpad, the Apple tablet would finally get mouse pointer support. This is very practical, since Bluetooth keyboards could be used so far. But the full computer experience was rather missing due to the touch operation.\\n\\nWhen all these innovations for Apple's mobile product line will be rolled out can only be estimated from experience. We expect a first insight into Apple's software developments at the end of March at the 'Ghost Keynote' for WWDC 2020, which - as long as Apple is planning the presentation without an audience - also has some hardware surprises in store, such as the introduction of the new iPad Pro or iPhone SE 2. The new operating systems will probably be rolled out as usual in autumn after the presentation of the new high-end devices.\",\n",

       "    'body': 'Taking a look back at another week of news and headlines from Cupertino, this week\\'s Apple Loop includes the latest iPhone SE leaks, a mysterious fourth iPhone 12, how Apple is fighting Coronavirus, the failure to update the MacBook\\'s webcam, the next release of iOS 14, a new 14-inch MacBook Pro, two new AirPods, and Apple\\'s new Android inspired home screen.\\n\\nApple Loop is here to remind you of a few of the very many discussions that have happened around Apple over the last seven days (and you can read my weekly digest of Android news here on Forbes).\\n\\nAll We Know So Far About The iPhone SE\\n\\nFollowing last week\\'s news on the upcoming (but still unannounced) iPhone SE 2020 Edition, more details are confirming what has been long suspected... Apple\\'s update to the iPhone SE, packing in as much power as possible in a smaller and cheaper handset will be launching this month.\\n\\nVarious retail stores have listed the handset as being available for pre-order, including JD.com in China, Verizon in America, and Apple\\'s own website:\\n\\n\"Under the accessories section on Apple\\'s website, there\\'s a listing for a \"Belkin InvisiGlass Ultra Screen Protection.\" Interestingly, it is mentioned to be compatible with the iPhone 7, the iPhone 8, and a newly added \"iPhone SE.\" While it may have been prematurely updated, this pretty much confirms that it will have the same design and dimensions as the iPhone 7 and 8, and might simply be called the iPhone SE, just like the last time.\"\\n\\nIn term of the handset itself, the expectation of the 2020 edition of the SE is to follow the design language last seen in the iPhone 8, paired up with specifications that match the iPhone 11:\\n\\n\"The low-cost iPhone will feature a 4.7-inch LCD display (likely supplied by LG), but will come upgraded with the same A13 chip that\\'s in the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, meaning it will be super speedy. It will include 3GB RAM, and it will continue to offer Touch ID instead of Face ID, with the Touch ID Home button at the bottom of the device.\\n\\n\"There will be a single-lens rear camera to keep costs low (likely the same camera used in the iPhone 8), and it is expected to come in space gray, silver, and red color options. Like Apple\\'s flagship iPhone lineup, it will not feature 3D Touch, instead likely adopting Haptic Touch. Storage options are likely to include 64, 128, and 256GB.\"\\n\\nMore on the iPhone SE 2020 specs at MacRumors.\\n\\nMOSCOW, RUSSIA - SEPTEMBER 29: An Apple phone is seen after Apple launched iPhone 8 and 8 plus at ... [+] the GUM department store in Moscow, Russia on September 29, 2017. (Photo by Sefa Karacan/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\\n\\nMeanwhile the iPhone 12 family is set to be graced by four different variants. While the iPhone 12 Pro and the iPhone Pro Max are expected, the iPhone 11 looks to have two different iPhone 12 models to replace it. With the key difference being screen size, are we looking at a vanilla iPhone 12 Max?\\n\\n\"Would Apple launch an iPhone SE in April, only to supersede it in September? I wouldn\\'t expect so... What does that mean for the two iPhone 12 models here? I personally think that the 5.4 inch iPhone 12 will be the base model, matching the $699 iPhone 11. With the iPhone 11 Pro priced at $999 Apple can easily slot the larger 6.1 inch iPhone 12 at $849.\\n\\n\"Think of it as the \\'max\\' model of the iPhone 12, offering equivalence to the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max.\"\\n\\nCountless companies are working to support the worldwide community effort against coronavirus, and Apple is no exception. Samuel Axon reports:\\n\\n\"Apple CEO Tim Cook took to a Twitter video to announce that the company will design and make face shields for medical workers battling the COVID-19 crisis, to the tune of one million shields per week. This announcement follows already publicised efforts to source face masks from the company\\'s supply chains; Cook said that effort has produced 20 million face masks to date.\"\\n\\nMore at Ars Technica. This effort sits alongside Apple\\'s own COVID-19 app, which offers details on the virus and its symptoms, what you can do, and guidance on testing. As we went to digital press, Apple and Google jointly announced an API to help healthcare services build contact-tracking apps before building the code into the underlying operating system. The Verge has more:\\n\\n\"Apple and Google will introduce a pair of iOS and Android APIs in mid-May and make sure these health authorities\\' apps can implement them. During this phase, users will still have to download an app to participate in contact-tracing, which could limit adoption. But in the months after the API is complete, the companies will work on building tracing functionality into the underlying operating system, as an option immediately available to everyone with an iOS or Android phone.\"\\n\\nWhy The MacBook Failed Its Latest Challenge\\n\\nOne thing that the coronavirus pandemic has exposed is a world ready for video conferencing. As the fortunes of apps such as Zoom, Skype, FaceTime, and Google Hangouts change rapidly, it\\'s clear that everyone needs a really good webcam. So how are Apple\\'s new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models holding up? Not very well.\\n\\n\"The universal 720p web camera barely sneaks into the megapixel range with a 1.2 megapixel camera. In the new world of self-isolation and lockdowns, there\\'s a sharp focus on weak webcams.\\n\\n\"...Tim Cook and his team would not have foreseen the rapid rise of video conferencing and home streaming that has happened over the last few weeks. But they were aware for years of the calls for a better webcam in the MacBook family, they would have been aware of the rise in game streaming, and they would have seen the feedback for FaceTime video across all their platforms.\"\\n\\nRead more on how the MacBooks have failed the challenge of coronavirus here on Forbes.\\n\\nA Small Update To iOS\\n\\nStaying with iOS, the latest version of iOS 13 has been released. Version 13.4.1 is an unexpected release, address two issues; one in FaceTime to address compatibility with older clients; and another to ensure smooth toggling of bluetooth. David Phelan has more details:\\n\\n\"One of the unforeseen consequences of installing iOS 13.4 and iPadOS 13.4 was that FaceTime calls may not work if you were FaceTime-calling someone who had iOS 9.3.6 or earlier versions of macOS, specifically El Capitan 10.11.6 or earlier. This has now been fixed...\\n\\n\"if you wanted to choose Bluetooth from the Quick Actions Menu, the one on the Home Screen when you swipe down from the top-right corner, it might not do what it should. With 13.4.1, everything should work just fine again.\"\\n\\nThe new 16-inch MacBook Pro has been launched, the new MacBook Air has been launched, so what about the 13-inch MacBook Pro? It looks like a data has been set. Tim Hardwick reports:\\n\\n\"Apple will announce a new 13-inch MacBook Pro in May with the codename J223, according to a rumor shared by YouTuber and leaker Jon Prosser... Apple could launch a new size for its smaller MacBook Pro offering, with any refresh potentially seeing a display bump to a 14-inch screen. Kuo has referred to a 14-inch model in the past, but it\\'s not clear that this size would feature in any impending refresh. The new 14-inch model would likely replace the 13-inch MacBook Pro , which would be discontinued.\"\\n\\nMore at MacRumors. Here\\'s hoping the update comes with the new scissor-switched \\'Magic Keyboard\\'!\\n\\nSHANGHAI, CHINA - 2020/01/12: American multinational technology company Apple logo seen on a screen ... [+] of a MacBook Pro in an Apple retail store in Shanghai. (Photo by Alex Tai/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\\n\\nApple\\'s plans for headphones in 2020 are a little clearer this week. Two new models are expected, with a pair of over-ear headphones due this summer (potentially after a WWDC announcement), and the AirPods X - the next entry in the AirPods line up - as the iPhone 12 family launches. Both are going to depart from the small \\'buds\\' look of the classic AirPods. Jacob Siegal has more:\\n\\n\"If the AirPods X look anything like the BeatsX, they will be a major departure for the brand in terms of design. While the AirPods Pro are smaller than the standard AirPods, they have a similar design, whereas the BeatsX are connected by a cord. That said, if Apple is going to \"phase out Beats\" ...the AirPods brand is likely going to expand beyond the defining look of the wireless headphones that launched in 2016.\"\\n\\nCustomisable widgets remains one of the areas where Android is far more flexible that Apple - the iOS \\'ribbon\\' does the job but it locks you into \\'the one true way; that Apple has decreed, until the options available on Android devices. That looks set to change with iOS 14 getting ready for improved widget support, Filipe Espósito reports:\\n\\n9to5Mac has found evidence on the iOS 14 code of another new feature internally referred to as \"Avocado\", which is related to the Springboard app that controls the Home screen.\\n\\n\"We can say that Apple is working to provide real widgets on the iPhone and iPad home screen for the first time. Instead of pinned widgets like on iPadOS 13, the new widgets on iOS 14 can be moved around, just like any app icon. The feature is still being implemented and may be scrapped by Apple.\"\\n\\nMore on 9to5Mac.\\n\\nApple Loop brings you seven days worth of highlights every weekend here on Forbes.

       "    'body': 'Apple has unveiled the latest iPhone and the latest enhancements, including a new biometric security offering called Touch ID. In addition, Apple confirmed that iOS 7 will be released later this month. So will Apple\\'s newest offerings have any impact to corporate security?\\n\\nApple has unveiled the latest iPhone and the latest enhancements, including a new biometric security offering called Touch ID. In addition, Apple confirmed that iOS 7 will be released later this month. So will Apple\\'s newest offerings have any impact to corporate security?\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Apple announced the iPhone 5S and the iPhone 5C, two devices that will replace the iPhone 5. However, while the consumer market will have their own opinions and thoughts on the latest Apple offering, the IT community is paying attention for different reasons. Tuesday\\'s announcement from Apple\\'s HQ in Cupertino, California also discussed iOS 7 and the biometric security offering, Touch ID.\\n\\nDuring Apple\\'s launch event, Phil Schiller, the senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said that passcodes were too cumbersome for some people. \"In our research about half of smartphone customers do not set up a passcode on their device, and they really, really should,\" he remarked.\\n\\nMore on Apple\\'s iPhone 5S and iOS7:\\n\\nApple\\'s iPhone 5S presents more questions than answers for businesses\\n\\nApple\\'s iOS 7 gives security pros a lot to like\\n\\nOne of the largest risks in a BYOD program is the lack of overall management and data protection; this is why passcodes are the default security setting applied to most devices. It isn\\'t full proof, but passcode enforcement is a solid building block. Yet, without enforcement, most device users skip the passcode, for the same reasons Schiller mentioned.\\n\\nIn order to address this issue, Apple used the technology acquired when they paid for $356 million for AuthenTec (a company that focused on identity management and fingerprint sensors) last July, to offer consumers a \"key you have wherever you go. Your fingerprint,\" Schiller said.\\n\\nThe fact that Touch ID will do more than just unlock the device, as it can act as a secure authentication mechanism for other iOS-based apps, as well as acting as a link to a user\\'s Apple ID -- enabling purchases from the various Apple stores (iTunes, App Store, iBookstore), sparked plenty of debate online.\\n\\nOn Twitter, many of the reactions were focused on privacy issues, and others debated how effective Apple\\'s implementation of biometrics would be in the long term. At issue is the fact that laptops have had biometrics for some time, and they are rarely used.\\n\\nOthers raised the point that biometrics were not considered when existing mobile management offerings were put into place, so there will need to be costly (in money and time) adjustments made. Apple, for their part, explained that the fingerprints used by the iPhone 5S would be encrypted and stored on the device\\'s A7 chip, and not on a server somewhere in the iCloud.\\n\\nMarcus Carey, inventor at Threat Agent, a company that provides security professionals with applications to do security assessments and training, pointed out on Twitter that the security industry needs two-factor authentication and biometrics. Instead of arguing, he said, security professionals \"should be thinking how you could leverage built in Biometrics in iOS to help secure your data.\"\\n\\nBut building ways to implement biometric data protection on top of authentication may be difficult unless Apple opens up. In a statement, the Fast Identity Online (FIDO) Alliance, said that while Apple\\'s announcement raises awareness around strong authentication, it amounts to little more than \"just another proprietary authentication solution, no different from terrific authentication solutions already in the marketplace.\"\\n\\n\"No matter how good an authentication solution may be, Apple\\'s or any others-until there are open standards for interoperability, the backend and the need for federated identity cannot be addressed, and nothing really changes.\"\\n\\nThe risk associated with Apple\\'s new identity feature is one that will need to be followed and examined as time goes on, but with an influx of new iPhones coming to the network, administrators and security minders will need to act sooner rather than later.\\n\\nThe key takeaway for many actively working in the field is that Apple\\'s offering is a start, and if it helps with the existing problems surrounding authentication, then that\\'s a good thing. The tick will be making it work with whatever\\'s already in place on the network.\\n\\nWith iOS 7 coming, should jailbreaking be a worry?\\n\\nYears ago, security managers and network administrators worried about iPhones because some users were jailbreaking their devices. Initially, the number of people with jailbroken devices was small, but once the concept took hold, others started doing it, but forgot to take basic security precautions, opening themselves (and in some cases their employers) up to increased risk.\\n\\nWith a new iOS release coming, the topic of jailbreaking is back in the spotlight. Already, a private jailbreak for iOS 6.1.4, running on an iPhone 5 has been demonstrated, but it hasn\\'t been made public. With the latest version of iOS coming later this month, the 6.1.4 jailbreak is unlikely to be released, but its existence proves that the jailbreaking community is alive and well.\\n\\nEarlier this year, in just four days, 7 million of Apple devices were jailbroken by consumers using the Evasi0n tool.\\n\\nJailbreaking happens because people want more from their devices, and providers like AT&T and Verizon maintain strict environments and application controls. This situation doesn\\'t account for the needs of the business when it comes to BYOD, complicating things some for organizations that demand or require controlled devices.\\n\\nSpeaking to CSO, Jay Freeman, the administrator for Cydia (the app store for jailbroken devices), when asked his opinion on jailbroken devices in a corporate setting, said that the general concerns are somewhat misplaced.\\n\\n\"In a corporate setting, I think that people are overly concerned about jailbroken devices and not sufficiently concerned about jailbreakable devices,\" Freeman told us.\\n\\n\"The concern is that the device is jailbreakable. It not being jailbroken yet doesn\\'t help [emphasis his]. In fact, if you jailbreak it, you might be able to install security patches, or other hardening features, on the device that will keep it from being attacked later.\"\\n\\nExisting mobile device management solutions will do little to stop jailbreaking, if they can stop it at all, Freeman explained when asked about such a protection.\\n\\n\"I have never heard of an MDM solution that could somehow prevent a jailbreak. And the concept of detecting a jailbreak from an app is fundamentally flawed as you are at the same privilege layer as the attacker (but play your hand later), so you will lose.\"\\n\\nWhen asked about the timing of jailbreaks in relation to iOS releases, Freeman pointed CSO to a post of his on Reddit, where he commented on how complicated the process can be. While many believe that jailbreaking a device is as simple as exploit-and-go, the reality is completely different.\\n\\nPrevious widely publicized jailbreaks relied on \"userland\" exploits -- or bugs that exist in software (such as a browser). The problem is that this created a cat-and-mouse game with Apple and the jailbreaking community. They\\'d discover weakness and jailbreak devices with it; Apple would patch that flaw and prevent the same trick from working again.\\n\\nThe iPhone4 was the last Apple device to be permanently jailbroken. But the existence of userland bugs created a misunderstanding when it came to the difficulty of jailbreaks and how they related to firmware updates.\\n\\n\"These userland jailbreaks require multiple bugs, and one of the bugs has to be in the kernel (in order to deactivate the codesign protection). Meanwhile, Apple has stepped up their game, adding stronger protections like kernel ASLR. This means that the jailbreak community is working with a dwindling supply of \"known bugs,\" has more complex challenges being faced to exploit these bugs, and operates under the knowledge that any new OS update fixes everything,\" Freeman wrote.\\n\\nSo with the pending release of iOS 7, following a beta where developers had access to the code for a short time, the notion of a jailbreak for it is still in the air. It will take some time however, as Freeman said that in general the jailbreak community doesn\\'t work with beta software for either development work or exploit finding.\\n\\n\"Apple betas tend to be a seriously moving target. Things that don\\'t affect developers or that aren\\'t \\'risky\\' thereby tend to end up in later betas, and bugs that are present early are often just temporary as Apple is \\'still working on it\\',\" he said.\\n\\nElsewhere, there is speculation that Apple\\'s new 64-bit architecture could lead to new exploits that are focused on specific bugs in the kernel or software. The downside is that such a change will also break many of the existing jailbreak extensions.\\n\\n\"My opinion is that it will make little or no difference in terms of security, vulnerabilities and exploitation. All the difficult parts about jailbreaking will remain as difficult but not more so than before. In terms of actually packaging a jailbreak for mass consumption, it\\'ll be a PITA to support an entirely different instruction set, but that\\'s just a question of engineering,\" commented on user to the Reddit thread.',\n",

       "    'title': \"Sign in with Apple FAQ: What you need to know about Apple's single sign-on platform\",\n",
       "    'body': 'At Apple\\'s Worldwide Developer Conference in 2019, it introduced a new single sign-on (SSO) solution called Sign in with Apple. Similar to the ever-present Sign in with Facebook and Sign in with Google options, Apple\\'s solution is meant to allow you to sign up for apps and sign in with a single ID instead of creating new ones for every app and service in the world.\\n\\nBut it differs from those options in several important ways. Here\\'s what you need to know about the Sign in with Apple SSO option.\\n\\nFocused on privacy\\n\\nThe main difference between Sign in with Apple and the Facebook, Google, or Twitter sign-in options you are probably used to seeing is that Apple\\'s solution is focused on privacy. There\\'s no tracking going on, and all efforts are made to minimize the amount of information about you that the app or service has access to.\\n\\nWhen you sign up using Sign in with Apple, you\\'re given the option to change the name you provide and to give the developer either your real email address (the one associated with your Apple ID) or a fake one.\\n\\nYour name and email (real or fake, your choice) is the only info that the developer gets from you, and Apple doesn\\'t collect any data about your interaction with the app.\\n\\nFree anonymous email forwarding\\n\\nIf you choose to hide your real email from the app, Apple will generate a new email address consisting of a string of random letters and numbers and @privaterelay.appleid.com. That address is the only thing the app or service gets, and Apple will forward along any mail sent to that address to your real one.\\n\\nIf the developer starts spamming you or sells your email to marketers, you can go to Apple ID settings and stop that address from forwarding mail to you.\\n\\nRequires two-factor authentication\\n\\nIn order to take advantage of Sign in with Apple, you have to have an Apple ID with two-factor authentication enabled. That\\'s the default for people who set up a new iPhone or iPad these days, so for most it shouldn\\'t be an issue.\\n\\nYou\\'ll also need iOS 13 or later installed on your iPhone or iPad, macOS Catalina 10.15 or later on a Mac, or tvOS 13 or later on Apple TV.\\n\\nNot just for Apple devices\\n\\nSign in with Apple is not just for use on Apple devices. You can use it on the web or potentially even Android devices. When you choose Sign in with Apple on those platforms, you\\'ll be taken to a secure Apple-hosted site to enter your Apple ID and password. You\\'ll then receive a two-factor authentication prompt on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac.\\n\\nYou\\'ll have the option to skip the two-factor authentication step for up to 30 days when logging in on the same device.\\n\\nOf course, it\\'s a lot simpler on an Apple device: you authenticate using Touch ID or Face ID, and and you\\'re in.\\n\\nPrimarily meant for new accounts\\n\\nFor the most part, you\\'re meant to select \"Sign up with Apple\" the first time you sign in to a new app or service. You might be able to use with apps and services you already have by associating your Apple ID with it (here are Adobe\\'s instructions, for example), but that sort of defeats the whole purpose.\\n\\nYes, it is convenient to simply authenticate with Touch ID or Face ID on your iPhone or iPad, but the real point of Sign in with Apple is to keep apps from having any more information about you than they need and to use a service from a provider (Apple) that won\\'t collect any information about your app use.\\n\\nAlmost mandatory\\n\\nSign in with Apple will soon going to be an option in nearly every app you use -- at least, you\\'ll see it in every app that has other single sign-on options.\\n\\nApple has made it a requirement for an app to be published in the App Store to provide Sign in with Apple as an option if the app offers any other third-party SSO solutions (like sign-in with Facebook, Google, or Twitter). That means you\\'ve got to have Sign in with Apple if you have Sign in with Facebook, unless you\\'re actually signing into a Facebook app. The deadline for that change was April 30, 2020, but it has been moved back to June 30 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nOf course you don\\'t have to use Sign in with Apple. You\\'re free to use whichever single sign-on option you want, or none at all. But if you want the benefits of enhanced privacy and no personal data tracking, it may be your best option.\\n\\nNote: When you purchase something after clicking links in our articles, we may earn a small commission.

That address is the only thing the app or service gets, and Apple will forward along any mail sent to that address to your real one.\\n\\nIf the developer starts spamming you or sells your email to marketers, you can go to Apple ID settings and stop that address from forwarding mail to you.\\n\\nRequires two-factor authentication\\n\\nIn order to take advantage of Sign in with Apple, you have to have an Apple ID with two-factor authentication enabled. That\\'s the default for people who set up a new iPhone or iPad these days, so for most it shouldn\\'t be an issue.\\n\\nYou\\'ll also need iOS 13 or later installed on your iPhone or iPad, macOS Catalina 10.15 or later on a Mac, or tvOS 13 or later on Apple TV.\\n\\nNot just for Apple devices\\n\\nSign in with Apple is not just for use on Apple devices. You can use it on the web or potentially even Android devices. When you choose Sign in with Apple on those platforms, you\\'ll be taken to a secure Apple-hosted site to enter your Apple ID and password. You\\'ll then receive a two-factor authentication prompt on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac.\\n\\nYou\\'ll have the option to skip the two-factor authentication step for up to 30 days when logging in on the same device.\\n\\nOf course, it\\'s a lot simpler on an Apple device: you authenticate using Touch ID or Face ID, and and you\\'re in.\\n\\nPrimarily meant for new accounts\\n\\nFor the most part, you\\'re meant to select \"Sign up with Apple\" the first time you sign in to a new app or service. You might be able to use with apps and services you already have by associating your Apple ID with it (here are Adobe\\'s instructions, for example), but that sort of defeats the whole purpose.\\n\\nYes, it is convenient to simply authenticate with Touch ID or Face ID on your iPhone or iPad, but the real point of Sign in with Apple is to keep apps from having any more information about you than they need and to use a service from a provider (Apple) that won\\'t collect any information about your app use.\\n\\nAlmost mandatory\\n\\nSign in with Apple will soon going to be an option in nearly every app you use -- at least, you\\'ll see it in every app that has other single sign-on options.\\n\\nApple has made it a requirement for an app to be published in the App Store to provide Sign in with Apple as an option if the app offers any other third-party SSO solutions (like sign-in with Facebook, Google, or Twitter). That means you\\'ve got to have Sign in with Apple if you have Sign in with Facebook, unless you\\'re actually signing into a Facebook app. The deadline for that change was April 30, 2020, but it has been moved back to June 30 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nOf course you don\\'t have to use Sign in with Apple. You\\'re free to use whichever single sign-on option you want, or none at all. But if you want the benefits of enhanced privacy and no personal data tracking, it may be your best option.\\n\\nNote: When you purchase something after clicking links in our articles, we may earn a small commission.

       "    'title': \"Apple Is Giving Up Its 30% Cut to Encourage 'Premium' Streaming Providers to Embrace Apple TV\",\n",
       "    'body': 'For years, Apple has insisted that all purchases of digital items and content within iPhone, iPad, and Mac apps must be made through its own in-app purchase program -- and subject to its 30% cut -- with no exceptions. It was a policy that\\'s rather infamously left apps like Amazon\\'s Kindle hampered by forcing users to skip out to a web browser in order to buy e-books and then return to the app in order to actually read them.\\n\\nThe same has been true with video apps, whether offering content for subscription or purchase -- if you wanted to put a \"Buy\" button in your app, you had to pay Apple a 30% cut of each and every purchase made by your customers. If developers didn\\'t want to share their revenue with Apple, their customers were stuck visiting a web page, without even being allowed to put links in the app to point their customers to their product pages.\\n\\nIt\\'s hard to argue that this policy has been consumer unfriendly, yet Apple -- a company that\\'s usually so focused on providing the best user experience possible -- has been intransigent in its stance, presumably feeling that it\\'s up to individuals developers to pony up if they wanted to take care of their customers. It also borders on being anticompetitive, as rivals like Spotify have claimed, since of course Apple doesn\\'t have to deal with this in its own apps (although to be fair, it\\'s unclear how the company accounts for revenue internally -- it could very well be paying itself a 30% cut between divisions, but either way it all contributes to Apple\\'s bottom line).\\n\\nHowever, it has recently came to light that Apple may actually be making one pretty big exception in order to encourage services to play nicely with the Apple ecosystem.\\n\\nYesterday, The Verge reported that Amazon\\'s Prime Video iOS and tvOS apps suddenly began letting customers make in-app purchases right in the app. This was a pretty big deal and an entirely unprecedented move from the company that was forced to take the \"Buy\" buttons out of its Kindle apps several years ago.\\n\\nWhile it wasn\\'t clear at first whether Amazon had just decided to suck it up and pay Apple its 30% fealty, especially since the prices hadn\\'t been raised to account for the extra expense, Apple later confirmed that it entered Amazon Prime Video into a special program for \"premium\" video providers that\\'s actually been around for several years; it just so happens that Amazon is the first big-name provider to take advantage of it.\\n\\nAccording to a statement by an Apple spokesperson, this already established program would seem to be designed to encourage video providers to get on board with Apple\\'s technology. Apple\\'s not simply letting providers keep that 30% cut in their pockets for nothing -- it expects something in return.\\n\\nApple has an established program for premium subscription video entertainment providers to offer a variety of customer benefits -- including integration with the Apple TV app, AirPlay 2 support, tvOS apps, universal search, Siri support and, where applicable, single or zero sign-on.\\n\\nSpecifically, it expects that these premium video providers integrate their services with the Apple TV set-top box. This means not only offering their own native tvOS apps, but tying into everything else that\\'s part of the Apple TV experience: AirPlay 2 support, universal search, Siri support, single sign-on, and of course integration with the Apple TV app. On this last one, it\\'s not clear if Apple simply means search integration from the TV app or an actual tie-in to Apple TV Channels, although we suspect it\\'s merely the former right now.\\n\\nTo be clear, the new policy only applies to one-time purchases (and rentals) of individual times like movies and TV shows and not actual subscriptions to things like Amazon Prime. In the case of purchases, these are processed through Amazon rather than Apple\\'s in-app purchase system, so they\\'ll be charged to whatever payment method the user has on file with Amazon and show up in your Amazon purchase history. So basically, for most people it\\'s just like making a purchase from Amazon\\'s web site, except that you no longer need to leave the app.\\n\\nWhat\\'s interesting, however, is that it does look like it will fall back to using Apple in-app purchases if the user doesn\\'t have a card on file with Amazon, so this is still definitely more than just an in-app link to the normal web site, and according to app developer Guilherme Rambo, there\\'s a special \"entitlement\" that\\'s been hiding with iOS and tvOS for a while now. It\\'s unclear if Apple still gets its 30% cut for those payments that end up going through through its own system.\\n\\nAmazon Prime actually isn\\'t the first premium video provider to join this exclusive Apple club, but it\\'s probably the first one you\\'ve actually heard of. Bloomberg\\'s Mark Gurman notes that Canal+ has been participating since 2018, and another service, Altice One signed up in February.\\n\\nOn qualifying premium video entertainment apps such as Prime Video, Atlice One and Canal+, customers have the option to buy or rent movies and TV shows using the payment method tied to their existing video subscription.\\n\\nThere won\\'t be a lot of services that will be able to take advantage of this new policy, to be fair, since many streaming services like Netflix and Spotify -- who have long railed against Apple\\'s 30% take -- don\\'t actually offer purchases or rentals, but it may be the first step in Apple loosening the reins a bit.\\n\\nBack in 2016, Apple reduced its cut to 15% for each subscription that continued beyond the first year, partly as a concession to developers but also as a way of encouraging them to offer quality subscriptions that keep customers paying, so it\\'s not hard to see how this might be another step in that direction, especially since it\\'s clear that Apple has been trying to turn its Apple TV ecosystem into an entertainment hub for a while. It\\'s had limited success in wooing other content providers to come on board with features like Apple TV Channels, so perhaps by sweetening the pot it hopes its partners can help to create a more unified Apple TV experience.',\n",

       "    'title': '4 Big Reasons to Love Apple Stock Now',\n",
       "    'body': 'When it comes to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), there\\'s one thing you can always count on. Innovation. Apple\\'s innovation is why it\\'s one of my favorite companies, and why my bullish rating on Apple stock is looking pretty good today.\\n\\nLike the rest of the world, Apple\\'s employees are hunkered down in their homes. But they\\'re still working, innovating and preparing some pretty awesome products to release later this year.\\n\\nThose products will be huge catalysts for Apple stock. And happily for investors, there is a ton of upside left.\\n\\nHere are some reasons why I\\'m really excited about the company these days, and why Apple stock gets an A rating in my Portfolio Grader.\\n\\nGranted, Apple saw some pretty big losses earlier this year. The novel coronavirus affected China first, knocking out the company\\'s production facilities. Apple lost about $200 billion in valuation in the last month as its market capitalization shrunk to $1.1 trillion.\\n\\nApple saw its iPhone sales fall by 28% in China just in January, and collapse by 60% in February. The company withdrew its 2020 guidance and issued a warning to shareholders that the coronavirus may limit sales and disrupt iPhone demand and supply.\\n\\nFor the fiscal second quarter that ends in March, Apple could see iPhone orders drop 18%.\\n\\nBut that doesn\\'t keep Apple from working harder to bounce back. In March, the company shut down much of its mammoth campus in Cupertino, California. Then it turned its employees loose to work at home on Apple\\'s most compelling and secretive products.\\n\\nThat\\'s a big move for a company that prides itself on secrecy.\\n\\nCan you imagine living next door to an Apple engineer these days, not knowing that they are turning the 5G iPhone or the next iteration of the Apple Watch into a reality just a few yards away? Because that\\'s what\\'s happening right now.\\n\\nFrom Bloomberg:\\n\\n\"Taking home a future product requires the green light from the vice president of an employee\\'s organization. That list of staff with future devices at their homes also is sometimes reviewed by Apple\\'s senior vice presidents, the management team run by Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook. As part of the work-from-home order, Apple has clamped down on which employees are allowed to take home future versions of software, including the next release of iOS, the platform that runs the iPhone and iPad. Like with hardware, employees working on unreleased software, such as the upcoming iOS 14, require approval from the highest levels of the organization.\"\\n\\nAs of now, Apple is still expected to release its next iPhone model this fall, including a 5.4-inch version, two 6.1-inch models and one 6.7-inch model.\\n\\nAnd it\\'s releasing tantalizing details about other new products, including the Apple Watch Series 6, which will reportedly be able to measure your blood oxygen level.\\n\\nThe company is also on course to launch an updated version of Apple TV and its HomePod 2 smart speaker.\\n\\nApple\\'s next iteration of the iPhone is widely expected to have 5G technology. That is a hugely exciting development -- and my loyal readers know what I think of 5G technology.\\n\\nIn short, 5G technology is huge because it is 100 times faster than 4G. That will allow you to have a Wi-Fi experience that\\'s just as good as if you were plugged in to a network. Plus you\\'ll get super-fast downloading times and great video streams.\\n\\nYou\\'ll also see things completely revolutionary, such as virtual reality healthcare services. And in this day and age of pandemics, the ability for a nurse or a doctor to assess a patient with video quality as crisp as an in-person assessment is critical.\\n\\nWhile there is mixed reporting about whether Apple\\'s iPhone 12 will be delayed, the phone itself is expected to be a big seller.\\n\\nReports indicate that it will complement its new camera technology with a LiDAR 3D scanner, which could provide a game-changing user experience.\\n\\nIt is also building its own 5G antennas -- rather than using bulky antennas offered by Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). These antennas will allow its phones to have larger batteries and extended life.\\n\\nSo why is this important for investors? Well, dramatic innovations will create buzz among iPhone aficionados. More consumers will upgrade to the newer devices. And, the buzz will allow Apple to charge a premium price.\\n\\nIf you\\'re among the millions of people following stay-at-home orders, you know how important your smartphones and tablets. These devices help consumers stay connected to the outside world.\\n\\nYou\\'re using Apple Music and buying stuff on the App Store more than usual right now. And that\\'s the type of user behavior that boosts Apple stock.\\n\\nApple\\'s Services division is a growing segment of Apple\\'s profitability, accounting for $12.7 billion in revenue in the company\\'s fiscal first quarter.\\n\\nAnd Services is important for Apple because it\\'s a high-margin business. The company charges fees to content developers who sell their products through Apple\\'s Services segment. It enjoys much bigger profit margins from App Store or Apple Music purchases than it does from smartphones or its entertainment division.\\n\\nThere are 1.5 billion active devices around the world that use Apple\\'s services, up 100 million from the end of 2018. Investors should expect to see another increase in both revenue and usage in fiscal Q2 and beyond.\\n\\nApple stock is currently down 18% year-to-date but the upside is much bigger. The consensus price target of $316 gives investors more than 30% upside right now.\\n\\nAnd Apple stock won\\'t stay depressed for long. Investors really don\\'t want to miss out on this fantastic long-term potential.',\n",

       "    'body': \"Since we're stuck indoors due to you-know-what, now's your chance to catch up on the latest shows and movies. If you are a bonafide Apple fan there's no better streaming device to get than an Apple TV streaming box. There are two devices to choose from: Apple TV HD and Apple TV 4K. They're both on sale right now, with the former going for as low as $144 (down from $149) at B&H Photo Video and the Apple TV 4K for as little as $169 (instead of $179).\\n\\nSo, which one should you choose? Well, if you've got a 4K TV already or are planning to buy one in the future, it's best to go for the Apple TV 4K. While they both have the same super-easy-to-use tvOS operating system, the Apple TV 4K has the upper hand in terms of features -- extending further than the fact it can stream in 4K Ultra HD (3840 x 2160), up from the Full HD (1920 x 1080) that the run-of-the-mill Apple TV HD maxes out at.\\n\\nApple TV HD -- $144, was $149:\\n\\nApple TV 4K (32GB) -- $169, was $179:\\n\\nApple TV 4K (64GB) -- $184, was $199:\\n\\nBoth set-top boxes look the same. If you're familiar with the Apple ecosystem, they resemble Mac Minis. With dimensions of 3.9 by 3.9 inches and a height of 1.4 inches, they'll fit comfortably into any home entertainment setup. They're also near-identical when it comes to port selection, except the Apple TV 4K has a USB Type-C port on the back. Both have space for a power cord, ethernet cable, and an HDMI cable (to hook them up to a television, of course).\\n\\nAs we mentioned earlier, the Apple TV 4K is more advanced than the standard Apple TV HD. There are Dolby Vision and HDR10 for drawing more detail from the scene at hand, as well as Dolby Atmos for expanding the soundstage by introducing height channels -- allowing sounds to be interpreted as three-dimensional objects, creating a more immersive audio experience. Both have Siri baked in for hands-free voice navigation.\\n\\nFinally, the Apple TV 4K has an Apple A10X Fusion CPU versus the Apple A8 found on the older model. The A10X features four cores in total and is designed to be over 50% faster than the A8. The speed difference between the two isn't nearly as significant as it would be on a mobile device like the iPhone or iPad, except when it comes to gaming. If you can't stand buffer times, you'll want to get the Apple TV 4K for the extra power.\\n\\nWhile you do get the same smart TV interface and content with both set-top boxes, the ability to stream in ultra-high definition, faster processing power, and better audio output makes the Apple TV 4K superior to the Apple TV HD overall. Besides, it only costs a few dollars more. And if you already own a 4K TV, getting the Apple TV 4K is a no-brainer.\\n\\nApple TV HD -- $144, was $149:\\n\\nApple TV 4K (32GB) -- $169, was $179:\\n\\nApple TV 4K (64GB) -- $184, was $199:\\n\\nClick here to learn how to set up your Apple TV.
